# What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of Science? 

> Tomas Petricek

> Draft - Work in progress
  
As a relatively recent discipline, computer science, and programming language research 
in particular, have so far eluded the eyes of philosophers of science. However, we can 
gain interesting insights by looking at classical works in philosophy of science and 
reconsidering their meaning from the perspective of programming language research.  

This is exactly what I attempt to do in this essay – I will go through some of the most 
important theories of science and look what they can say about programming language 
research. Then I suggest how we can improve our scientific practice in the light of 
these observations. 

First, I discuss how understanding the research programme is important for evaluating 
scientific contributions. Second, I argue that overemphasis on precise, mathematical 
models in early stage of research may limit the creativity. Thirdly, I propose how 
to design stand-alone (theory-independent) experiments in program- ming language research 
and how this can help to integrate the vast amount of knowledge gathered by 
software practitioners.
