# What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of Science? 

> Tomas Petricek

> Draft - Work in progress
  
Compared to physics, biology or chemistry, we can hardly call computer science an 
established discipline. The research in the design of programming language is even 
younger. As such, it has so far eluded the eyes of philosophers of science.
Nevertheless, we can still learn a lot by looking at classical works in philosophy 
of science and reconsidering their meaning from the perspective of programming languages. 

This is exactly what I attempt to do in this essay. I will go through some of the 
most important theories of science and look what they can say about the programming 
language research and then suggest how we can improve our scientific practice in the 
light of these observations.

First, I discuss how understanding the research programme of work is important for 
evaluating its contribu-tions. Second, I present evidence for the claim that 
overemphasis on precise, mathematical models in early stage of research may limit 
the creativity. Third, I propose how to design more long-lasting experiments in 
programming language research and how this can help to integrate the vast amount 
of knowledge gathered by software practitioners.
