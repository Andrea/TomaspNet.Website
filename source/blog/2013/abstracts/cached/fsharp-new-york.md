<p>Exactly two weeks ago, I started a three month internship at BlueMountain Capital in New York.
They have a <a href="http://techblog.bluemountaincapital.com/">technical blog</a> and should be well known to the
F# community thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/BlueMountainCapital/FSharpRProvider">R type provider</a>
which was written by Howard Mansell (<a href="https://twitter.com/hmansell">@hmansell</a>).
I'll have the pleasure of working with Howard on some more open source data-science related tools for F#
(and C#). I'll write more about these when we have something to share, but if you want to
contribute and help us, join the Data and Machine Learning <a href="http://fsharp.org/technical-groups/">working group at F# Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from my work, I'm also happy to get involved with the great F# community in New York!
We already have some events planned - <strong>Progressive F# Tutorials</strong> and <strong>FastTrack to F#</strong> are
scheduled for September 16.-19. so you can become an F# guru in 4 days :-). But I'm also happy
to have a chat with anyone interested in F# and perhaps do a lunch time talk, if you need to
convince your colleagues or boss that F# is a good choice.</p>
