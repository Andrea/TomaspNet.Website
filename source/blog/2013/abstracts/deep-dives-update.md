It has been some time since I [last wrote about F# Deep Dives](http://tomasp.net/blog/manning-deep-dives.aspx/)
- a new project that I'm working on together with [Manning](http://www.manning.com),
[Phil Trelford](http://trelford.com/blog) and a number of F# experts, so I'd like to write a quick
update. In summary, working on a book with more than 10 co-authors is more difficult than one
would think (and 10 people cannot write a book in 1/10 of the time :-)), but now that the holidays
are almost over, you can expect more frequent updates again!

First of all, I shoud mention that you can buy [the Early Access preview](http://www.manning.com/petricek2/)
of the book from Manning and there is already one [in advance review of the book](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2013/01/05/Review+In+Advance+F+Deep+Dives.aspx)
from Ted Neward (thanks!) who says:

As I mentioned, the book is unique in that it is not written just by me and Phil - each chapter 
is written by a real-world F# expert and many of them use F# in production. The disadvantage is
that they are all busy people, but we have close to half of the planned chapters available already...
