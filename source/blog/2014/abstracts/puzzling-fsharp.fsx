Do you need to convince your friends & family that programming can be fun? 
For the last Christmas, I got a puzzle as a gift. It is a number of small
cubes, joined together, that can be rotated and folded to form a bigger
(4x4x4) cube. 

We spent the last few days of the year with family and a couple of friends
and I left the puzzle on the table. Every time I walked around, someone was
playing with it without much success. In the end, I said that if noone solves
it until 31 December, I'll write a program to do it. Which I did between 7 PM
and 8 PM and, voilà, here is what I got...

</div>

So, how do you solve a puzzle in about 1 hour on New Year's eve?
