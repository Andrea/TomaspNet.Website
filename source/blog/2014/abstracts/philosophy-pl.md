As someone doing programming language research, I find it really interesting to think
about _how_ programming language research is done, how it has been done in the past
and how it _should_ be done. This kind of questions are usually asked by philosophy
of science, but only a few people have discussed this in the context of computing
(or even programming languages).

So, my starting point was to look at the classic works in the general philosophy of science 
and see which of these could tell us something about programming languages. 

I wrote an article about some of these ideas and presented it last week at the
second symposium on [History and Philosophy of Programming](http://www.computing-conference.ugent.be/hapop2).
For me, it was amazing to talk with interesting people working on so many great 
related ideas! Anyway, now that the paper has been published and I did a talk, I should 
also share it on my blog:

 * [What can Programming Language Research Learn from the Philosophy of 
   Science?](http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/index.html)
 * Fairly minimalistic [slides from my talk at the 
   symposium](http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/philosophy-pl-aisb.pdf) 

One feedback that I got when I submitted the paper to Onward! Essays last year was that
the paper uses a lot of philosophy of science terminology. This was partly the point of 
the paper, but the feedback inspired me to write a more readable overview in a form of 
blog post. So, if you want to get a quick peek at some of the ideas, you can also read
this short blog (and then perhaps go back to the paper)!
