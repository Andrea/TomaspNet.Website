<p>In a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-samples.aspx">recent blog post series</a>,
  I wrote about parallel programming samples that accompany the 
  <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>
  book by patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. The F# translation of the samples that I
  wrote about mostly followed the style used in the book, so it used patterns that 
  are typical for C#. However, some of the samples can be written in F# in a more interesting way...</p>
<p>In this article, we'll take a look at agent-based implementation of the Image pipeline 
  example (from chapter 7). A <em>pipeline</em> is a useful pattern if you need to process large
  number of inputs in parallel and the processing consists of multiple phases or steps. In the
  original implementation, the pipeline was implemented using <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code>
  and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> types from .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll show a 
  version that uses F# agents and asynchronous workflows. We'll use a <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  type, which is <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-blockingagent.aspx">discussed in another 
  article</a>. It represents a queue with limited capacity that asynchronously blocks the process that is adding 
  values if there is no space in the buffer and blocks the process that reads values when there are no 
  values. This type can be elegantly used to implement the pipeline pattern. In this article, we'll 
  demonstrate it by writing a four-phase pipeline that processes images. As you'll see, 
  the agent-based version of the code is very much easier to write and has similar performance as 
  the original version.</p>
