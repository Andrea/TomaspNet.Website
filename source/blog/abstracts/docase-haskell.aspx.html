<p>Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/match-bang-paper.aspx">paper about <em>joinads</em></a> and the <code>match!</code> extension
  of the F# language. The paper was quite practically oriented and didn't go into much details about 
  the theory behind <em>joinads</em>. Many of the examples from the F# version relied on some
  imperative features of F#. I believe that this is useful for parctical programming, but I 
  also wanted to show that the same idea can work in the <em>purely functional</em> context.</p>

<p>To show that joinads work in the pure setting, I created a Haskell version of the idea.
  The implementation (available below) is quite simple and consists of a pre-processor for 
  Haskell source files and numerous examples. However, more important part of the recent work of 
  joinads is a more detailed theoretical background.</p>

<p>The theory of joinads, together with the language design of Haskell extension that implements
  it is discussed in a paper <em>Extending Monads with Pattern Matching</em>, which was accepted
  for publication at the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2011/index.html">Haskell 
  Symposium 2011</a>. Here is the abstract of the paper:</p>

      <p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      Sequencing of effectful computations can be neatly captured using monads and elegantly written using 
      <code>do</code> notation. In practice such monads often allow additional ways of composing computations, 
      which have to be written explicitly using combinators.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We identify joinads, an abstract notion of computation that is stronger than monads and captures
      many such ad-hoc extensions. In particular, joinads are monads with three additional operations: 
      one of type <code>m a -> m b -> m (a, b)</code> captures various forms of <em>parallel composition</em>, 
      one of type <code>m a -> m a -> m a</code> that is inspired by <em>choice</em> and one of type <code>m a -> m (m a)</code> 
      that captures <em>aliasing</em> of computations. Algebraically, the first two operations form a 
      near-semiring with commutative multiplication.
      </p><p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
      We introduce <code>docase</code> notation that can be viewed as a monadic version of <code>case</code>. Joinad laws
      make it possible to prove various syntactic equivalences of programs written using <code>docase</code> 
      that are analogous to equivalences about <code>case</code>. Examples of joinads that benefit from the notation
      include speculative parallelism, waiting for a combination of user interface events, but also 
      encoding of validation rules using the intersection of parsers.
