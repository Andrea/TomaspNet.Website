<p>In the fourth part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll take a look at the Adatum Financial 
  Dashboard sample. The sample is a part of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide, but the F# translation
  contains several additional interesting aspects that I'll introduce in this article.</p>

<p>The sample simulates a financial modelling application that performs processing of market
  data in several steps that can be partly executed in parallel. In this article we'll compare two
  implementations. The first one (similar to the C# version) uses the <code>Task&lt;'T&gt;</code> type 
  from .NET 4.0 and chains steps using the <code>ContinueWith</code> method. The second version is 
  F# specific and it implements step as a sequential computation wrapped in asynchronous 
  workflows. Partial results are reported to the user interface using events.</p>
