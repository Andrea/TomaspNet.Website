<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/parallel-extra-image-pipeline.aspx">previous article</a>, we 
  briefly introduced the <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type and we used it to implement the
  pipeline pattern (from Chapter 7 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>)
  using asynchronous workflows. The type was used to represent intermediate buffers with a limited size.
  In this article we'll take a look at the implementation of the type. The type implements a very useful
  pattern in agent-based parallel programming, so you can use it in your work, but it could be also 
  interesting as a demonstration of the F# <code>Agent&lt;T&gt;</code> type (an recommended alias 
  for the <code>MailboxProcessor&lt;T&gt;</code> type).</p>
<p>The <code>BlockingQueueAgent&lt;T&gt;</code> type is similar to <code>BlockingCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> 
  from .NET 4.0. It has methods for adding and removing elements that block when the operation cannot be
  done (e.g. adding when the queue is full or removing when the queue is empty). The most important 
  difference is that it can be used <em>asynchronously</em>. This means that when we call its operations
  form F# asynchronous workflow (using <code>let!</code> and <code>do!</code>), the operation will block
  the calling workflow, but it will not block any physical thread. We start by looking at the overall
  structure of the agent and then look at the body of the agent which implements its behavior (using
  a state machine)...</p>
