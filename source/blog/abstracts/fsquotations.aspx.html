
<p>This article describes very simple code that I wrote while learning
  how to work with the F# quotations library. Using the F# quotations you 
  can get tree representation of the quoted expression. This allows you
  to write code that takes code written in F# as data and performs some
  code analysis or compiles/translates that code to different language.
  This is very similar to the new C# 3.0 expression trees where you can 
  get expression tree from lambda expression and translate this tree 
  for example to SQL (using DLINQ). However expression trees in C# 3.0 
  are very limited when compared with F# quotations, so that's one of 
  the many reasons why F# is interesting language.</p>
