<p>As you can see, there has been quite a bit of silence on this blog for a while. 
  There are two reasons for that - the first is that I'm still working on the book 
  <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real World Functional
  Programming</a>, so all my writing activities are fully dedicated to the book. The second
  reason is that I'm having a great time doing an internship in the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/ppt">Programming Principles and Tools</a> group
  at Microsoft Research in Cambridge with the F# team and namely the F# language 
  designer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a>. 
  The photo on the left side is the entrance gate to the Trinity College of the Cambridge
  University taken during the few days when there was a snow. I recently started using
  Live Gallery, so you can find more photos from Cambridge in my <a href="http://cid-8c3f26b4befe2dfa.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20-%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">online gallery</a>. Anyway,
  I just wanted to post a quick update with some information (and downloads!) related
  to the book...
