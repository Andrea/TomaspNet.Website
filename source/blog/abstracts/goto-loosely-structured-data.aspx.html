<p>About two weeks ago, I gave a talk at <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/">GOTO Conference</a> in
  Copenhagen at a very interesting .NET session organized by <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk /">Mark Seemann</a>.
  In my talk, I focused on the impedance mismatch between the data structures that are used
  in programming languages (such as classes in C# or records and discriminated unions in F#)
  and the data structures that we need to access (such as database, XML files and REST services).
   </p>

<p>Clearly, both of the sides have <em>some structure</em> (otherwise, it wouldn't be possible
  to write any code against them!). Even an XML file that is returned by a REST service has some
  structure - although the only way to find out about the structure may be to call the service
  and then look at the result. In this article, I'll briefly summarize the ideas that I 
  presented in the talk. Here are links to the slides as well as the source code from the 
  talk: </p>
