<p>In this webcast, we'll look at improving the code for downloading and
  processing RSS feeds that I presented in <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the second part</a> 
  (if you didn't see earlier parts, <a href="fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">the first one</a> was an introduction to 
  basic functional ideas). The previous part demonstrated how to use .NET libraries
  and we implemented a simple <code>downloadUrl</code> function for obtaining content
  of from the web and we've also seen how to load the data into an XML document object
  and how to filter items. In this part, we'll modify the code to run asynchronously and 
  potentially in parallel. To use some of the functionality, you'll need to get 
  <code>FSharp.PowerPack.dll</code>, which is available with the VS 2008 installation or
  as a separated download for VS 2010 [<a href="#fswc_asy">4</a>].

<p>Now that we have the first version of the code, we can start <em>refactoring</em> it.
  I'm using the term in a slightly vague meaning - we're of course going to change the
  behavior of the code. We'll wrap it into F# <em>asynchronous workflow</em> to run
  without blocking threads and we'll also run multiple downloads in parallel. However,
  this can still be viewed as refactoring in some sense, because we're not changing
  the <em>core</em> behavior of the code. As you can see from the webcast, these kinds of
  refactorings are also very nicely supported by F# syntax...</p>
