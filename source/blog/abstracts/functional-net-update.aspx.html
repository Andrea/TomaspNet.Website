<p>Recently, I announced on my blog that I’m working on a book for <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> 
  called <em>Real world Functional Programming in .NET</em>. The goal of the book is to explain the most interesting and
  useful ideas of functional programming to a real world C# developer. I'm writing this book, because I believe that functional programming is becoming
  increasingly important. Here is a couple of reasons why you should have this book on your bookshelf:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ideas behind C# 3.0 and LINQ</strong> - these main-stream technologies are inspired by functional programming and the new 
    C# 3.0 features give us definitely much more than just a new way to query databases. The book explains
    the ideas behind these features and shows how to use them more efficiently.</li>
    
  <li><strong>Learning the F# language</strong> - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx" type="external">F# is becoming a first-class citizen</a>
    in the Visual Studio family of languages, which alone would be a good reason for learning it! Even if you're not going
    to use it for your next large .NET project, you'll find it useful for quick prototyping of ideas and testing how .NET libraries
    work thanks to the great interactive tools.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Real world examples</strong> - the book includes a large set of real-world examples that show how to develop 
    real applications in a functional way - both in F# and C#. Among other things, the examples show how to utilize multi-core 
    CPUs, how to better obtain and process data and how to implement animations and GUI applications in a functional way.</li>
</ul>  

<p>The book is available via the MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) and if you want to get a better idea what is the book about, 
  you can read the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/" type="external">first chapter for free</a>. Anyway, it is more than a month since I  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-programming-book.aspx">posted the announcement</a>, so I decided to write a brief update....</p>
