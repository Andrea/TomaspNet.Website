<p>You can use LINQ to write queries that perform grouping of data using <code>group by</code>
  or ordering of data using <code>orderby</code> clause. LINQ provides the default
  (and the most common) implementation of both of the operations, but sometimes you 
  may need a slightly different behavior when grouping or ordering data (this article
  is motivated by a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194761/can-i-use-linq-to-retrieve-only-on-change-values" type="external">question on StackOverflow</a>
  which needs to do exactly that for grouping).</p>
  
<p>Let's look at a simple example, which shows when we may need a different behavior when 
  grouping data. For example, we may have the following list of stock trades
  containing a name of a stock and the price of the trade (stored for example as a list
  of <code>TradeInfo</code> classes with properties <code>Name</code> and <code>Price</code>):</p>  
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Price = 80.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 70.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 100.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 200.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Price = 300.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 30.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Price = 20.00 } }</pre>  
<p>Now, we may want to group adjacent trades into a single summary record which will contain
  the name of the stock (which is same for all trades in each group), the number of trades 
  in the group and an average price in the group. The desired results are:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
{ { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 75.00 },
  { Name = "GOOG", Count = 3, AvgPrice = 200.00 },
  { Name = "MSFT", Count = 2, AvgPrice = 25.00 } }</pre>  
<p>The operation that we want to do is very similar to <code>group by</code> in LINQ, but 
  it doesn't do quite the same thing! If we used <code>group by</code>, we would get only 
  two groups as the result. However, as I wrote earlier, we want to group only 
  <em>adjacent trades</em>. You could write your own extension method to do this,
  but then you need to leave the elegant LINQ query syntax. In this article, I'll show
  you how to get the desired results using a simple LINQ query with a <code>group by</code>
  clause...</p>
