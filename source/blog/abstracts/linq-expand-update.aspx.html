  The question is whether LINQ (and especially LINQ to SQL) provides any simple way to return only records that contain one or more of 
  specified keywords in the name. The question looks simple, but it is simple only if you know the number of keywords that you want to 
  look for. In this case you can write following LINQ query:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="c">// Products that contain "kwd1" or "kwd2" in the name </span><br />
  <span class="k">var</span> q = <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
    <span class="k">where</span> p.ProductName.Contains("kwd1") || p.ProductName.Contains("kwd2")
    <span class="k">select</span> p;
</pre>
<p>The problem with previous code is that you can't use it if the list of keywords is dynamically entered by user
  (and so its length may vary). Of course, if you want to run query on in-memory data, you can get very nice results by
  writing extension method called <code>ContainsAny</code> that performs test for keyword array, but if you 
  want to be able to translate query to SQL, the situation is a bit complicated.</p>
