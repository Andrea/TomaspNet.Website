<p>In my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/phalanger-future-notes.aspx">last post</a> about Phalanger I mentioned 
  that our important goal is to support the Silverlight (2.0) platform. Shortly Silverlight is a cross-browser 
  platform that can be used for developing client-side components that run in the web browser and contain
  rich media, graphics and can interactively communicate with the user. The language that can be used for
  writing Silverlight code can be in general any .NET language, so our goal is to allow using PHP by 
  making Phalanger compatible with Silverlight.</p>

<p>First steps were already made and it is becoming possible to write some very interesting things in 
  Silverlight using PHP, there is of course still a lot of work to do and we're discussing the future 
  development with PHP development team (you can join the mailing list <a href="http://news.php.net/php.on.dlr" type="external">PHP on DLR</a> for more info).
  In this article we will first show a very basic Silverlight example that uses PHP and later I will 
  shortly comment more complicated example - a game (quite addicting, so be careful :-)!) where you have to 
  fly with helicopter and avoid the walls. The source code for helicopter game is also attached, so feel free
  to modify it or create similar games!</p>
<p>If you can't wait to try the demos before looking at the sources, here are the links:</p>
