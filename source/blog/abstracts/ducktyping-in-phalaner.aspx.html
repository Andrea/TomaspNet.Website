<p>When you want to call PHP scripts from mainstream .NET languages, like C# you can follow two different ways.
  First you can use the pure mode as I demonstrated in one of the earlier articles 
  on PHP application called Texy!. This approach can be used only for
  some specific applications, because pure mode has several restrictions - the two most important restrictions
  are that no global code or inclusions are allowed (you have to specify all source files during the
  compilation), but thanks to this restrictions Phalanger is able to produce classes that are compatible
  with .NET and can be called from C#. Second option is to create object dynamically by its name and
  perform all method invocations by name too. This approach can be used with any PHP scripts, but
  it isn't very convenient. In this article we present new features in the Phalanger beta 4 which 
  extend the second approach and make it possible to use objects from any PHP script in C# using 
  type-safe way.</p>
