<p>Generic numeric code is some calculation that can be used for working with multiple different numeric 
  types including types such as <code>int</code>, <code>decimal</code> and <code>float</code> or even our own 
  numeric types (such as the type for <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-custom-numeric.aspx">clock arithmetic 
  from the previous article of the series</a>). Generic numeric code differs from ordinary generic F# code such 
  as the <code>'a list</code> type or <code>List.map</code> function, because <em>numeric code</em> uses numeric operators 
  such as <code>+</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> that are defined differently for each numeric type.</p>

<p>When writing simple generic code that has some type parameter <code>'T</code>, we don’t know anything about 
  the type parameter and there is no way to restrict it to a numeric type that provides all the operators that 
  we may need to use in our code. This is a limitation of the .NET runtime and F# provides two ways for 
  overcoming it.</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><strong>Static member constraints</strong> can be used to write generic code where the actual 
    numeric operations are resolved at compile-time (and a generic function is specialized for all required
    numeric types). This approach makes resulting code very efficient and is generally very easy to use
    when writing a function such as <code>List.sum</code>.</li>

  <li><strong>Global numeric associations</strong> (available in F# PowerPack) give us a way to obtain 
    an interface implementing required numeric operations dynamically at runtime. This approach has some 
    runtime overhead, but can be used for complex numeric types (such as <code>Matrix&lt;'T&gt;</code>).</li>

  <li><strong>Combination of both</strong> techniques can be used to implement complex numeric type
    that is generic over the contained numeric values and has only a minimal runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>

<p>Static member constraints are a unique feature of F# that is not available in other .NET
  languages, so if you're interested in writing numeric code for .NET,
  this may be a good reason for choosing F#. In C# or Visual Basic, you would be limited to the 
  second option (which can be implemented in C#). In dynamic languages (like IronPython), everything
  is dynamic, so numeric computations can work with any numeric type, but will be significantly
  less efficient. In the rest of the article, we look at the three options summarized above.
