<p>Anders Hejlsberg announced the support for asynchronous programming in the next version of C# announced at PDC 2010.
  The extension looks very similar to F# asynchronous workflows (which are already available in Visual Studio 2010). 
  Despite the large similarity, there are a couple of differences between the two programming models. I already mentioned 
  some of them briefly in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/csharp-fsharp-async-intro.aspx">the first article of this series</a>.
  In this article, we'll look at some of the technical differences between the two models.</p>

<p>The most notable non-technical difference is that F# asynchronous workflows are already available in a 
  supported version of Visual Studio and can be used on a large number of .NET runtimes (including, for example,
  Windows Phone and Silverlight). However, there are surprisingly many technical differences as well.
  In this article, I'll talk about the support for cancellation, which is available in F# and is not
  (currently) available in the C# preview. We'll also look at the difference between model where tasks
  are created as running and the delayed model.</p>

<p>This article is the second part of a short series about the asynchronous programming support
  in C# and F#. The previous article shows a simple example in both of the languages and the next
  articles explain how does the feature work (and how you can customize its behavior) as well as 
  how to call F# libraries from C#:</p>

<p>Let's start by looking at, perhaps, the most important technical difference - the 
  built-in support for cancellation available in F# asynchronous workflows.</p>
