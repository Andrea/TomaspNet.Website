<p>Another area where the <code>match!</code> syntax can be used is when programming with F# <em>agents</em>,
implemented by the <code>MailboxProcessor</code> type. Formally, agents do not form the monad
structure in a useful way - when programming with agents, we do not compose a new agents,
but instead we write code that (imperatively) receives messages from the agent's mailbox
and handles them.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates an <code>agent { ... }</code> computation builder that can be used for 
implementing the body of an agent. Normally, the body of an agent is an <em>asynchronous
workflow</em>. The code in the body uses <code>let!</code> to perform asynchronous operations, most 
importantly to call <code>inbox.Receive</code> to get the next message from the inbox. When the
agent intends to handle only certain kinds of messages, it can use <code>inbox.Scan</code>. When
using the <code>agent</code> builder, pattern matching on messages can be written using <code>match!</code> and
it is possible to write code that ignores certain types of messages simply by writing an
incomplete pattern matching.</p>
