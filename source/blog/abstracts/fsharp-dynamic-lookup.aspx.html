<p>Many people view <em>dynamic</em> and <em>statically-typed</em> languages as two distinct groups (and 
  this is often a reason for never-ending discussions). In this article, I'll try to show one interesting
  example, which demonstrates that these two groups are not in fact that distinct and that you can implement
  a common <em>dynamic</em> language feature in F#, which is undoubtedly <em>statically-typed</em>.
  The feature that I'm talking about is dynamic invoke using a symbolic representation of the member
  (this is something that can be done using <em>symbols</em> in Ruby, but I'll shortly explain what exactly I mean).</p>  
<p>I intentionally wrote <em>statically-typed</em> and <em>dynamic</em> instead of <em>dynamically-typed</em>.
  In my understanding <em>dynamic</em> is a broader term while <em>dynamically-typed</em> and 
  <em>statically-typed</em> are of course two distinct groups. On the other side <em>dynamic</em> refers
  to language features that are usually available in <em>dynamically-typed</em> languages, just because
  it is easy to support them in a nice way. This doesn't mean that having a <em>dynamic</em> feature in
  a <em>statically-typed</em> language would be impossible - it is just more difficult to implement it in 
  a way that would be similarly elegant.
