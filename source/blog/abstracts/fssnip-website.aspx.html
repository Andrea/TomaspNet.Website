<p>When writing F# programs, I often write some nice code snippet or some useful helper
  function that I'd like to share with the F# community. Unfortunately, my blog posts are
  usually longer and more elaborate, so I never get to blogging about it. Now that I have a 
  twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/tomaspetricek">follow me if you don't already</a>)
  I thought I could just post the snippet somewhere, but there was no 
  good web site for posting F# snippets - until now! </p>

<ul>
  <li>If you can't wait any further, then go directly to the new F# snippets web site at
  	<a href="http://fssnip.net">fssnip.net</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The web site uses my earlier project <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fswebsnippets-intro.aspx">F# Web Snippets</a> to format F# source
  code. It highlights colors and adds JavaScript tooltips using services provided by the
  F# compiler, which means that you'll get almost the same experience as when reading code
  in Visual Studio. I also wanted to make the page a repository of browsable snippets, so you can use
  it in two ways...</p>
