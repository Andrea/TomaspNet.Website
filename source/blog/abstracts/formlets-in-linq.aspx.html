<p>The LINQ query syntax can be used for various things. Aside from writing queries, you can 
  also use it to encode any <em>monads</em>. This has become a fashionable topic, so you can learn
  more about it at many .NET conferences (for example <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=434">GOTO 2011</a>).
  There are also many blog posts on this topic and I explained it in details in Chapter 12 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a>, which
  is available as a <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf">free sample chapter</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>However, you can also use LINQ syntax for writing different types of computations. In a 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/idioms-in-linq.aspx">previous blog post</a>, I introduced <em>idioms</em>
  (also called <em>applicative functors</em>) and I demonstrated how to use the <code>join</code> syntax in LINQ
  to write computations based on idioms. We looked at a slightly boring, but simple example - zipping of lists - and
  we also implemented matrix transposition.</p>
 
<p>In this blog post, we look at a more exciting example. I explain <em>formlets</em>, which is an <em>idiom</em>
  for building web forms. Formlets give us an elegant functional way to create reusable components that encapsulate
  both visual aspect (HTML) and behavior (processing of requests). You can think of them as functional ASP.NET controls.
  Formlets come from the <a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/">Links project</a> and they are now used in commercial products like
  <a href="http://www.websharper.com/tutorials/GettingStartedWithFormlets.aspx">WebSharper</a>. In this article, you'll see that we can (mis)use LINQ to get a nicer syntax
  for writing code using formlets. My C# implementation of formlets is based on a nice <a href="http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2011/01/simple-implementation-of-formlets-in-f.html">F# formlets by Mauricio
  Scheffer</a>.</p>
