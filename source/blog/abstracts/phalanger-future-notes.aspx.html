<p>First, I'd like to aplogoize for the lack of new about the Phalanger project recently. I spent some time working
  as an intern with the F# team in MSR Cambridge and I also had final bachelor exam this autumn. Anyway, this doesn't
  mean that there isn't anything new and interesting regarding the Phalanger project comming soon - actually (as I 
  believe) the opposite is true! The topics that I'm going to further discuss in this article is our upcomming 
  support for Silverlight platform, the relation between Phalanger and DLR and also our desire to make 
  Phalanger more open to the community, so stay tuned!</p>
