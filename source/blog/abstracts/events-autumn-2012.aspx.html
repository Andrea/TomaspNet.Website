<p>Similarly to the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-autumn-2011.aspx">last year</a>,
  I already have a number of F# events planned for the end of the summer and autumn that 
  I'd like to invite you to!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/08/VS2012-Live">Visual Studio 2012 has been completed</a>
  recently and it comes with F# 3.0. For me, this means two things. Firstly, it is the second
  Visual Studio version of F#, which means that functional programming is worth taking seriously.
  Secondly, F# 3.0 comes with <em>type providers</em>, which is a killer feature for working with
  data. No matter if you're a C# programmer now to functional programming or if you're an F#
  user in the real-world, I hope you can find some interesting and useful event below!
</p>

<p>The two main things that I'm going to be involved in are SkilsMatter trainings in London and New York
  and a few events at the biggest functional conference (ICFP) in Copenhagen...</p>
