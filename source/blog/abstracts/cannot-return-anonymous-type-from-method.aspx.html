<p>One of the new features introduced in C# 3.0 which will be available in Visual Studio "Orcas" (currently in CTP version) 
  is anonymous type. Anonymous type is something very similar to tuple type from Cω [<a href="#returnanonymous">1</a>] (which is based 
  on tuple types known from many functional programming languages including F#). Anonymous types are extremely useful in 
  LINQ queries, because it allows you to construct type with several properties without declaring the type (with all the properties).
  Example of query with anonymous type looks like this:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
var q = from c in db.Customers
        where c.Country = "Czech Republic"
        select new { FullName=c.Name+" "+c.Surname, Address=c.Address };
</pre>  
<p>Ok, it's probabbly not the best example, but it demonstrates the point - you want to return some information from query
  and you don't need to declare type that contains <code>FullName</code> and <code>Address</code> properties before, because
  you need it only for this single query (and you want to return only these two fields, so you don't transfer additional 
  data that you don't need from database).</p><p>Now let's get to the second point... </p>
