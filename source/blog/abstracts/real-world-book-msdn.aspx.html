<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>
 book) asked me if I'd be interested in collaborating on a project for MSDN. The idea 
 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my
  book, right under <em>Visual F#</em>. If you can't wait to check it out, here are all the links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh314518.aspx">Real-World Functional Programming</a> section on MSDN.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&amp;ac=8">source code for individual chapters</a> is available on MSDN Code Gallery.</li>
  <li>I also published <a href="http://functional-programming.net/msdn/">annotated TOC with source code links</a> on my functional programming web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on the articles, I also wrote about a few topics that we didn't use in the final version. You'll see them on my blog in the next few days, as soon as I edit them into a blog post form. <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/real-world-book-msdn.aspx">Continue reading</a> for more information about individual chapters.</p>
