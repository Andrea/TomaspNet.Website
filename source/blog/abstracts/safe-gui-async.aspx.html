<p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-non-blocking-gui.aspx">previous article</a>,
  I discussed how to use F# asynchronous work&#173;flows for creating reactive user-interfaces.
  One of the main concerns was to avoid blocking the GUI thread (to prevent the user-interface
  from freezing). The workflow shouldn't perform any CPU-intensive compu&#173;tation when running
  on the GUI thread.</p>

<p>The standard F# library provides two ways to run a computation on a background thread from
  an asynchronous workflow. The <code>StartChild</code> operation starts an operation 
  in the thread pool and returns a workflow that can be called using asynchronous (non-blocking)
  <code>let!</code> construct. The <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation can be called
  using <code>do!</code> and resumes the rest of the workflow on a background thread.</p>

<p>When using the <code>SwitchToThreadPool</code> operation, we also need to eventually use
  <code>SwitchToContext</code> to transfer the execution back to the GUI thread (after 
  completing the CPU-intensive calculations). In this article, I describe a variation of 
  F# asynchronous workflows that keeps track of the running thread in the type of the 
  computation. As a result, calling a workflow that should be executed on a GUI thread 
  from a background thread is a compile-time error as opposed to failing at runtime.</p>
