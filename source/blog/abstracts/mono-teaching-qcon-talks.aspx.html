<p>It appears that I have been doing a lot more talking than writing in the last two months.
  I'm hoping to change this direction and I have two articles almost ready, so stay tuned!
  I was also posting all my interesting F# snippets to <a href="http://fssnip.net/authors/Tomas+Petricek">fssnip.net</a>,
  which has grown quite a bit since I announced it in the last blog post. Thanks to everybody
  who submitted their snippets already and I'm looking forward to more! By the way, you can
  now run snippets using <a href="http://tryfs.net/">tryfs.net</a> by clicking at 
  "Load in TryF#" button.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the queue with talk materials that I wanted to post on my blog 
  has grown to 3. I talked about F# in MonoDevelop in the <a href="http://weblog.savanne.be/376-fosdem-2011-mono-room-slides">Mono room at FOSDEM</a> in February, 
  then I did an online talk for the <a href="http://www.communityforfsharp.net/">Community for F# </a>.
  Finally, this week, I did a tutorial on F# with <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/">Phil Trelford</a>
  at QCon in London (to fill in for Michael Stal due to unexpected health reasons).</p>

<p>Before I move on to writing about my recent experiments with LINQ, you can find materials from
  all of the recent talks below... </p>
