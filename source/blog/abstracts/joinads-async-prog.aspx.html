<p>Asynchronous workflows provide a way of writing code that does not block a thread
when waiting for a completion of long-running operation such as web service call,
another I/O operation or waiting for the completion of some background operation.
In this article, we look at the new expressive power that <em>joinads</em> add to 
asynchronous workflows written using the <code>async { ... }</code> block in F#.</p>

web page. If you read the article there, you can run the examples interactively
and experiment with them: <a href="http://tryjoinads.org/index.html?use/async.html">view the article on TryJoinads</a>.</em></p>
