<p>In an article about building LINQ queries at runtime in C# 3.0, I described how you can build
  a LINQ query dynamically, for example by combining a set of conditions using the 'or' operator in the
  where clause. I mentioned that the way I implemented it is largely influenced by the F# language, 
  which provides very natural way for manipulations with code like this. In this article I will first 
  shortly introduce FLINQ sample, which is an F# library implementing LINQ support and than I will 
  implement the same examples I presented in the earlier article in F#.</p>
