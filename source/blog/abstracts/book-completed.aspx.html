<p>If you're following my blog or if you're interested in F# or functional programming in .NET, 
  you probably noticed that I was working on a book <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>.
  At some point, we called it <em>Functional Programming for the Real-World</em>, but then we changed the title back
  to a better sounding version <em>Real-World Functional Programming</em> (subtitle <em>With examples
  in F# and C#</em>). The book is also reason for a lower number of blog posts over the last year. Over the last 
  month or so, we were doing the final edits, reviewing the final PDF version (I fixed quite a lot minor 
  issues, synchronized book with the Beta 2 F# release and so on). Anyway, before a few days, I received the following 
  email (as an author, I receive the same emails as those who ordered the book through the <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">Manning 
  Early Access Program</a>, so that I can see what we're sending to our dear readers):</p>

Dear Tomas Petricek, <br />
We are pleased to announce that <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is now complete! As a MEAP subscriber 
you can download your copy of the finished ebook right now! (...) This ebook is the final version, 
identical to the softbound edition, which is currently being printed and will be available on <strong>December 24</strong>. 
If you chose the printed book option when you originally subscribed, we'll ship it to you automatically—no action required 
from you. </p>

<h2>Finally finished!</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right. The book is finally completed and as far as I know, it has been printed last week! If you already 
  ordered the book, you won't receive it before Christmas, but it should come shortly after. I can't wait to see the
  book actually <em>printed</em>. The transition from the Word drafts I initially wrote to a final PDF version
  was already felt fantastic and I thought <em>"It looks like a real book!"</em> Among other things, there are now 
  graphical arrows with comments inside listings, which looks really great and makes code listings much easier to read.
  Now I can look forward to seeing the <em>actual book</em>. Maybe I'm too conservative, but I have to say that I'm 
  really glad that I wrote the book before everything is going to be published just electronically!</p>
