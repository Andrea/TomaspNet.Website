<p>Now that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010/default.mspx" type="external">Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1</a> is out, it is finally a good time to take a look at 
  one of the (in my opinion) most interesting new features in the new release - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2009/05/20/visual-studio-2010-beta1-with-f-is-now-available-plus-matching-f-ctp-update-for-vs2008.aspx" type="external">the F# language</a>. F# existed for
  quite a long time now as Microsoft Research project, but is now becoming a real Microsoft product.
  Interestingly, F# is still available as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=7bb32f32-9fac-4f34-ad56-b0bda130cf00" type="external">plugin for Visual Studio 2008</a>, so if you want to try it
  you don't have to install the whole new beta of 2010.</p>

<p>There are already many resources for learning F# including my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/functional-overview.aspx">functional programming overview</a>,
  which is a Manning Greenpaper for the book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" type="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a> that I'm writing with Jon Skeet
  and my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">four-part F# introduction</a>. There are also some useful links on the 
  official <a href="http://www.fsharp.net">F# web site</a> including some talk recordings. However, I haven't yet seen any good F# webcast focusing 
  mainly on showing F# source code, starting from simple functional concepts to the real-world features like asynchronous workflows and object-oriented 
  programming in F#, so I decided to create one.</p>
<p style="text-indent:0px;"><strong>So, here it is...</strong></p>
