<p>The beginning of a new year may be a good time for writing one lightweight blog
  post that I wanted to publish for some time now. During my last internship with the
  F# team at MSR, I did some work on improving the F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio. This
  mostly involved the usual features - automatic completion, colouring and tooltips.
  The F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2010 still isn't perfect, but I think it is safe
  to claim that it is the best IDE experience for a typed functional programming language
  (aside, you can vote for some F# IDE features <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2149735-improve-intellisense-support-for-f-">here</a>
  and <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2213611-provide-refactoring-support-for-f-code-">here</a>).
