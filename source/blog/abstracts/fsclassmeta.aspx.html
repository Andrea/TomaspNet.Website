  of program source code. If you're not familiar with quotations I recommend reading my 
  previous article [<a href="#fsclassmeta-links">1</a>] that contains short introduction
  to this topic first. Quotations can be used for example for translating subset of the F# language to 
  another code representation or another language.</p>
  
<p>To get the quotation data of the expression you can either use <code>&lt;@@ .. @@&gt;</code> 
  operator or <code>resolveTopDef</code> function. In the first case the code written
  between the "<code>&lt;@@</code>" and "<code>@@&gt;</code>" is converted to data during the compilation.
  The <code>resolveTopDef</code> function allows you to get quotation data of top-level 
  definition (function) from compiled library at runtime (you have to use <code>--quotation-data</code> 
  command line switch while compiling the library). I mentioned that quotations can be used to represent 
  only subset of the F# language. Currently, one of the quotation limitations is that it's not possible to 
  enclose the whole class in the quotation operators. It is also not possible to get the representation 
  of the whole class at runtime nor the representation of class members (for example methods). </p>
<p>In this article I'll present a simple method that makes it possible to use F# quotations for working with classes as well, however this is rather a prototype that can be used for experimenting and discovering areas where working with classes might be useful, not a fully working solution.</p>
