<p>This article shows how to implement the <em>joinad</em> structure for one of the 
simplest monads - the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type. This is a slightly oversimplified example. 
The <code>match!</code> construct can be used to write patterns that specify that a monadic
value (in this case <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code>) should contain a certain value, or we can specify
that we do not require a value. When working with options, this means the same thing 
as matching the value against <code>Some</code> and against <code>_</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>However, the example demonstrates the operations that need to be implemented and
their type signatures. Later articles give more interesting examples including
parsers and asynchronous workflows (and you can explore other examples if you look
at the <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Joinads">FSharp.Joiands source code</a> at GitHub).</p>
