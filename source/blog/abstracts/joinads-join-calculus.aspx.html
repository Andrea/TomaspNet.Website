<p>Join calculus provides a declarative way of expressing asynchronous synchronization
patterns. It has been use as a basis for programming languages (JoCaml and COmega), but also
as a basis for libraries (embedded in C# and Scala). Using joinads, it is possible to 
embed join calculus in F# with a nice syntax using the <code>match!</code> construct. Formally,
join calculus does not form a <em>monad</em>, but it can be viewed as a version of <em>joinad</em>
as described in the <a href="../pubs.html">first paper on joinads</a>.</p>

<p>The programming model is based on <em>channels</em> and <em>join patterns</em>. A channel can be viewed
as a thread-safe mailbox into which we can put values without blocking the caller. In some
sense, this is quite similar to <a href="agents.html">F# agents</a>. A join pattern is then a rule
saying that a certain combination of values in channels should trigger a specific reaction
(and remove values from the channels). The ability to match on multiple channels distinguishes
join calculus from F# agents.</p>
