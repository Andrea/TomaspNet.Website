<p>The end of the summer holiday season is getting closer. Luckily, I was in Prague last
week so I actually noticed there was summer this year!</p>

<p>After a few quiet months, the autumn is going to be quite busy.
  Microsoft's <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//build/</a>
  conference will reveal the future of software development for Windows,
  but great things are going on in the F# world too. Don Syme is going to talk about 
  <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/fsharp3">F# Information Rich Programming</a>
  at Progressive F# Tutorials in November, which should reveal more about F# 3.0 and type providers!</p>

<p>I have quite a few speaking engagements planned already, so
  if you want to learn about functional programming in .NET (and become a better
  C# programmer) or about F# and asynchronous programming,
  here are a few events that you may be interested in...</p>
