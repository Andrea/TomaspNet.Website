<p>Mathematical duality [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">2</a>] 
  is a very useful and elegant concept that gives us a nice way of speaking
  about objects or structures that behave in some way exactly conversely. There
  is no clear definition of what <em>duality</em> is. However, the idea is that when we
  have two structures that behave conversely and we know that something is true
  about the first one, then we get the opposite statement about the other structure
  "for free" (if you know how to translate from one structure to the other).</p>

<p>In this article, I'll talk about an interesting example of duality that (to my best
  knowledge) wasn't described by anyone before. The two dual structures are 
  <strong>references between objects</strong> in a normal program and <strong>references
  between events</strong> in a reactive application. The statement that is going to 
  become obvious thanks to the duality principle is describing which of the objects (or
  events) are garbage and can be safely collected by garbage collector.</p>

<p>This topic is in much more details 
  discussed in a paper [<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/event-object-duality.aspx
#duallinks">4</a>] I wrote with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/">Don Syme</a> 
  and that I presented at the ISMM Workshop (see also <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/pldi-2010-trip.aspx">my
  trip report from PLDI</a>). In this article, I'll try to give an accessible
  description of the most interesting idea from the paper...</p>
