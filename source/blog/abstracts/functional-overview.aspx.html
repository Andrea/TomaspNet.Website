  Functional programming languages have been around for a while and were always astonishing for their 
  ability to express the ideas in a succinct, declarative way allowing the developer to focus on the 
  essence of problem rather than on technical details of the solution. Recently, functional paradigm is 
  gaining new prominence as an efficient way to handle development of multi-processor, parallel and 
  asynchronous applications.</p>

<p>
  Functional ideas are arising in C# as well as in other main-stream languages and functional languages 
  are becoming an alternative for real-world projects.  Also, Microsoft recently introduced a new 
  language called F#, which has a strong background in traditional functional languages, but as a .NET 
  language also benefits from the rich .NET and Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

  This article is partially an excerpt from my book <strong><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">Real-world Functional Programming in .NET</a></strong> [<a href="#fpgpref">1</a>]. 
  Thanks to my editors at <a href="http://www.manning.com" type="external">Manning</a> I have the permission
  to publish it on my blog. We’ll look at several aspects of functional programming and how the same 
  concepts, which are essential for the functional paradigm, look in the F# and in C# 3.0 with LINQ. We 
  will shortly look at the basic programming language features like lambda functions and type inference 
  that are now available in both F# and C#. Functional programming isn’t only about language features, 
  but also about using different programming style, so we’ll look at some high level concepts as well. 
  These include using immutable data structures for developing code that can be executed in parallel 
  and writing code in a more declarative style.</p>

<p>
  Thanks to the combination of C# 3.0 and F#, this article shows the ideas in a way that should be 
  familiar to you in C#, but also shows a further step that you can take with a primarilly functional
  language F#. If you're a .NET developer and you want to understand what functional programming is
  and how it can help you to become better and more productive then continue reading. If you'll find 
  this article interesting, then don't forget to check out the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">book</a>,
  which explains everything in larger detail and discusses many other interesting ideas.</p>
