
<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/">LINQ Project</a> [<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/" target="_blank">^</a>] is 
  an extension to .NET Framework and most important .NET languages (C# and VB.Net) that extends these languages with query operators and some 
  language features that make it possible to integrate queries in the languages. Thanks to LINQ you can write queries that read data from database
  (or any other data source). For example, imagine that you want to write set of queries for eshop and you need to perform a price calculation
  in more queries. The problem with LINQ queries is that you can't simply call a function written in C# that calculates price. The following example
  is NOT WORKING for this reason:</p>
<pre>
<span class="c">// function used in filter</span><br />
<span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">decimal</span> CalcPrice(Nwind.Product p)
{
  <span class="k">return</span> p.UnitPrice * 1.19m;
}</pre>
<pre>
<span class="c">// query that uses MyFunc</span><br />
<span class="k">var</span> q = 
  <span class="k">from</span> p <span class="k">in</span> db.Products
  <span class="k">where</span> CalcPrice(p) &gt; 30m
  <span class="k">select</span> p
</pre>
<p>I think that this is a big limitation, because when you want to keep some more complex logic in the data access layer you should be able to reuse 
  parts of queries that are similar across more queries. The good thing is that with latest release, LINQ became extensible so it is possible
  to write a extensions that allow this scenario...</p>
