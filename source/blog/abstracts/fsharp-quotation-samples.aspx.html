<p>Some time ago, Granville Barnett (see his <a href="http://gbarnett.org/">homepage and old blog</a> [<a href="http://gbarnett.org/" target="_blank">^</a>]
  or a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gbarnett/">new blog</a> [<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gbarnett/" target="_blank">^</a>]) 
  had a great idea and started a CodePlex project called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples">F# Samples</a> [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fsharpsamples" target="_blank">^</a>]
  to host various samples written in F# to demonstrate the most important
  concepts of both functional programming and F#. I quite like this idea, so I asked Granville if I could join and add some
  samples that I wrote and today I finally found a time to update what I wanted to upload to the latest version of F# and put it
  online.</p>
