<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/book-source-available.aspx">mentioned</a> that I was doing my second internship
  with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/" type="external">Don Syme</a> at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
  This time, I was in Cambridge for 6 months from October until April, so it has been more than a month since 
  I left, but as you can guess I didn't have time to write anything about the internship until now... There isn't
  much to say though, because the internship was simply fantastic. Cambridge is a beautiful place (here are
  some <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2008%20Autumn%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">autumn</a> and <a href="http://cid-6ddff5260c96e30a.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/2009%20Winter%20-%20Cambridge" type="external">winter</a> photos),
  the Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge is full of smart people, so it is a perferct working environment
  (except that you realize that you're not as clever as you think :-)). Also, it is just a few meters away from the
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk" type="external">Computer Laboratory</a> of the Cambridge University, so there are always many 
  interesting talks and seminars. So, big thanks to Don Syme, James Margetson and everyone else who I had a chance 
  to work with during the internship.</p>
  
<p>One of the reasons why I didn't have much time to write about the internship earlier is that I
  was invited to the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> shortly
  after the end of the internship. I had a chance to talk about my project there as well and there is
  even a video recording from the talk (the link is below), so you can watch it to find out more about my recent F# work.</p>
