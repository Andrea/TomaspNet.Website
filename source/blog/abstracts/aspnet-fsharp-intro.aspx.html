    for representing logical structure of .NET source code. These classes are used for generating Web service references
    (using <code>wsdl.exe</code> tool), for generating typed datasets and in many other situations. The most interesting
    use of CodeDOM classes is in ASP.NET where ASP.NET generates code from <code>aspx</code>/<code>ascx</code> files and 
    compiles this code into web site assemblies (together with the code written in code behind files).</p>

  <p>This means, that you can use any language for developing ASP.NET web sites, as long as you implement CodeDOM provider
    that generates source code from CodeDOM structure and can compile these source files (this can be simply done by executing 
    command line compiler). 
I was recently working on CodeProvider for the F# language, and finally it supports everything
    what is needed by ASP.NET (however it is complete and it doesn't work for example with <code>wsdl.exe</code>). Using this
    CodeDOM provider you can write ENTIRE web site in F# (including in-line code enclosed in &lt;% ... source code ... %&gt;).
    I also created project template for F# web site that can be imported to Visual Studio 2005, so you can easilly try 
    writing web pages in F#...</p>
