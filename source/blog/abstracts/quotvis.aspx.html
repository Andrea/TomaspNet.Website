

<p>I already <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">explained</a> what F# quotations are
  and I explained how you can do some simple manipulations with it. In this article I'd like to 
  present an application that I wrote and that can be helpful when working with quotations. 
  It displays clear graphical representation of given F# quotation (using Windows Forms TreeView control).
