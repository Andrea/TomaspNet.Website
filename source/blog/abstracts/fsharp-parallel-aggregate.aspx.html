<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll explore examples of parallel aggregation 
  from Chapter 4 of <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>, which is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The C# version of the sample is in details discussed in the guide. In this article,
  we'll look at the F# translation and in particular at several functions from the <code>PSeq</code>
  module. Some of the functionality is currently available only in the "PSeq.fs" distributed with the
  samples, but will eventually appear in F# PowerPack as well. </p>

<p>Aggregation of data in parallel is an interesting problem. As we've seen in the previous article, 
  PLINQ and tasks make it easy to parallelize independent blocks of code that don't share any state.
  Unfortunatelly, not all programs are like that. In particular, we often need to aggregate all
  elements of a sequence - when writing sequential code in F#, you would use the <code>Seq.fold</code>
  function. In this article, we'll look at functions that implement fold parallel.</p>
