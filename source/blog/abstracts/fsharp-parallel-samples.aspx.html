<p><a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> is a 
  guide written by the patterns &amp; practices group at Microsoft. It introduces .NET programmers to
  patterns for including parallelism in their applications (using support for parallel programming in
  .NET 4.0). It introduces techniques such as parallel loops, parallel tasks, data aggregation and so on.
  The book includes numerous samples in C# and Visual Basic that can be easily copied and adapted 
  to match your needs.</p>

<p>As part of a contracting work for the F# team, I developed an F# version of the samples, which is 
  now available on the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">book web site</a>.
  You can get it by downloading <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/releases/view/50473">F# code samples</a> (ZIP) from the 1.0 release, or you can download the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets" 
  type="external">latest version of the source code</a> directly. The F# version of the
  code is mostly a direct translation of the C# versions, but there are a few interesting places that
  are worth discussing. In particular, some of the samples use the <code>PSeq</code> module from F#
  PowerPack and I also added a version of one example that uses F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<p>In this article series, I'll look at several interesting examples from the F# version of the source code.
  We'll look how to use PLINQ and Tasks (which are available in .NET 4.0) from F# (Part II.) including some advanced topics such 
  as the Map-Reduce algorithm (Part III.). We'll also look at a larger example built using tasks and an alternative 
  implementation using asynchronous workflows (Part IV.) Here are links to the individual articles:</p>
