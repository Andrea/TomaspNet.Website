<p>In this article we'll look at several improvements that can be done to the Financial dashboard example
  (originally from the <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel Programming with Microsoft .NET</a> book).
  When I was translating samples in the book from C# to F#, the sample struck me, because it looks like
  a perfect fit for F# asynchronous workflows (instead of the <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type used in the
  C# version). I already talked about an <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-parallel-adash.aspx">alternative 
  implementation</a> based on asynchronous workflows. However that version was still following some of the
  programming patterns, from the original C# version, which are not idiomatic in F#. In this article, I'll talk
  about a few other improvements that we can make to the sample...</p>

<p>In the original version of the sample (in both C# and F#), we explicitly checked whether a cancellation
  token has been cancelled in every single operation. This was needed in C#, because tasks do not support
  cancellation automatically. However, F# asynchronous workflows make cancellation easier. They automatically
  check if the computation should be cancelled at the beginning and the end of every asynchronous call. Our
  first change will be to use this feature. Also, the original version propagates a <code>null</code> value
  when the computation is cancelling. In F# we don't need that and we'll only change the type of the overall
  result to <code>option&lt;T&gt;</code>, so that we can notify the user interface (but we don't need to 
  propagate cancellation explicitly). Finally, the original version contained sequential implementation, but
  didn't provide any way of actually running it, so we'll do a bit of refactoring to make that sample 
  actually useable.</p>
