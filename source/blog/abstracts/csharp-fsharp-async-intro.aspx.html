<p>One of the exciting new technologies that was announced at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC 2010</a>
  is the support for <em>asynchronous programming</em> in C#. So what exactly is <em>asynchronous programming</em>?
  Many applications today need to connect to some service or external data source including, for example, 
  Web Services and REST APIs. This calls may take a long time to run, but we want to run them without
  blocking the application.</p>

<p>Currently, you can run the operation on a background thread or using a <code>Task</code>, but
  coordinating multiple such operations is difficult. What if you for example need to wait until
  any (or all) of downloads complete and run some more code then? This is not only difficult, but
  it also scales badly, because blocking .NET threads is a bad practice (Threads are expensive and when
  they're just waiting for other operation to complete, we're wasting valuable resources).
  This problem has been the main motivation for including <em>asynchronous workflows</em> in F#
  about 3 years ago. In F#, this also enabled various interesting programming styles - for example
  <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/net/Programming-user-interfaces-using-f-sharp-workflows.aspx" type="external">creating 
  GUI using asynchronous workflows</a> (also discussed in Chapter 16 of <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">my book</a> and in 
  in <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">my recent talk</a>). The C# asynchronous 
  programming support and the <code>await</code> keyword is largely inspired by
  F# <em>asynchronous workflows</em> (I was quite surprised that F# wasn't more visibly 
  mentioned in the PDC talk).

<p>In this article series, I'll demonstrate both F# and C# asynchronous programming model,
  I'll look at features that are missing in one or the other as well as a few subtle differences
  (that may be unexpected) and finally, I'll write about writing (asynchronous) F# libraries 
  that are easy to use from C#. The plan for the series is following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous C# and F# (I.): Simultaneous introduction</strong></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-csharp-differences.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (II.): How do they differ?</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/async-compilation-internals.aspx">Asynchronous C# and F# (III.): How does it work?</a></li>  <li>Asynchronous C# and F# (IV.): Calling F# libraries from C# <em>(not yet available)</em></li>
</ul>  
<p>Let's start with a brief overview of asynchronous programming features in C# and F#...</p>
