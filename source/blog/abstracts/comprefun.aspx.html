This article is a re-publication of an article that I wrote some time ago for 
<a href="http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/">The Monad.Reader</a> magazine, which is an
online magazine about functional programming and Haskell. You can also
read the article in the original PDF format as part of the <a href="http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/issue18.pdf">Issue 18</a>
(together with two other interesting articles). The samples from the article can be found <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/Haskell.Joinads">on Github</a>.

<p>Monad comprehensions have an interesting history. They were the first syntactic extension for 
programming with monads. They were implemented in Haskell, but later replaced with plain list
comprehensions and monadic <code>do</code> notation. Now, monad comprehensions are back in Haskell,
more powerful than ever before!</p>

<p>Redesigned monad comprehensions generalize the syntax for working with lists. Quite interestingly, 
they also generalize syntax for zipping, grouping and ordering of lists. This article shows how to 
use some of the new expressive power when working with well-known monads. You'll learn what 
"parallel composition" means for parsers, a poor man's concurrency monad and an evaluation 
order monad.</p>
