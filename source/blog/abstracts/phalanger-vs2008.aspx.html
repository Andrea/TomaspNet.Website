<p>At the <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks.asp" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> I presented several new features
  in Phalanger. I already posted the presentation and samples on the blog (<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/phalanger-at-langnet.aspx" type="external">here</a>)
  and the talk is also available as a video on the Lang.NET web site (<a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/talks.asp" type="external">here</a>
  - actually, due to the huge demand the site is down now, but I hope it gets back soon!) Anyway, the most interesting thing is that
  I've used Phalanger Integration for <strong>Visual Studio 2008</strong> during the talk, which wasn't available in any Phalanger release until now.</p>
<p>I have to mention one more thing before talking more about the new release - Phalanger Integration for VS 2008 works with Visual Studio Shell, 
  which means that you can get <strong>Visual Studio 2008 with Phalanger Support for free!</strong> Yes, that's right. Microsoft offers
  so called Visual Studio 2008 Shell, which is an "empty" IDE with no integrated languages and you can install Phalanger Integration into
  this version, which means that you can get very good Phalanger IDE (for Windows) for no cost at all!</p>
<p>If you can't wait to install this new version, you can skip the overview article and <a href="/blog/phalanger-vs2008.aspx#phpm08down">go directly to the installation links</a>.</p>
