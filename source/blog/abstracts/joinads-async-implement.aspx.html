<p>The article <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">Asynchronous workflows and joinads</a> gives numerous
examples of programming with asynchronous workflows using the <code>match!</code> construct.
Briefly, when matching on multiple asynchronous workflows, they are executed in 
parallel. When pattern matching consists of multiple clauses, the clause that matches
on computations that complete first gets executed. These two behaviours are 
implemented by the <code>Merge</code> and the <code>Choose</code> operation of joinads. Additionally, 
asynchronous workflows require the <code>Alias</code> operation, which makes it possible to 
share the result of a started asynchronous workflow in multiple clauses.</p>

<p>In this article, we look at the definition of the additional <code>AsyncBuilder</code>
operations that enable the <code>match!</code> syntax. We do not look at additional examples
of using the syntax, because these can be <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/joinads-async-prog.aspx">found in a previous article</a>.</p>
