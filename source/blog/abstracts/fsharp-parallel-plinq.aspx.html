<p>In this part of the Parallel Programming in F# series, we'll look at some basic examples of parallel 
  programming in F# that are available in <a href="http://parallelpatterns.codeplex.com/" type="external">Parallel 
  Programming with Microsoft .NET</a>. This is a guide that introduces common parallel programming patterns
  on .NET 4.0. The guide discusses the samples in C#, but it also contains an F# translation of the source
  code. Since the languages are different, the F# version deserves a brief explanation.</p>
  
<p>In this article, we'll discuss some of the F# examples and we'll look at a couple of aspects that
  are specific for F#. In particular, we'll look at working with Parallel LINQ (both directly and using
  <code>PSeq</code> module from F# PowerPack) and working with tasks. We'll also look at an interesting 
  example (using closures) where C# version doesn't behave as expected, but a literal translation in F# corrects the 
  problem.</p>
