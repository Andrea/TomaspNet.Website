<p>The work on my book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a>
  is slowly getting to the end. I'm currently creating index for the last couple of chapters 
  and doing final updates based on the feedback from reviews and also from the
  <a href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=460&amp;start=0" type="external">forum at manning.com</a>
  (this means that if you have some suggestions, it's the best time to post them - I haven't yet replied
  to all of them, but I'll certainly do that before the manuscript will go to the production).</p>
