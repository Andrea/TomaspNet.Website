<p>In this article, we define an F# numeric type for calculating in the modular arithmetic (also called clock arithmetic)
  [<a href="#ppcnuml">1</a>].  
  Modular arithmetic is used for calculations where we want to keep a value within a specified range by counting in cycles. 
  For example, a maximal value on clock is 12 hours. When we add 11 hours and 3 hours, the value overflows and the result is 
  2 hours. Aside from clocks, this numeric system is also essential in cryptography or, for example, in music.</p>

<p>This tutorial shows several techniques that are essential when defining any new numeric type in F#. Most importantly, you’ll learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a numeric type with overloaded operators </li>
<li>Define a numeric literal for constructing numbers of our new type</li>
<li>Enable calculating with our type in F# lists and matrices</li>
<li>Hide implementation details of a numeric type</li>
</ul>

<p>We define type <code>IntegerZ5</code> that implements modular arithmetic with modulus 5, meaning that valid values are in the range 
  from 0 to 4 and we equip the type with operations such as addition and multiplication. When an operation produces a value that would 
  be outside of the range, we adjust it by adding or subtracting the modulus (in our case 5). Here are some examples of calculations 
  that we’ll be able to write:</p>
<pre>
2 + 1 = 3 (mod 5)
4 * 2 = 3 (mod 5)
List.sum [ 0; 1; 2; 3 ] = 1 (mod 5)
</pre>

<p>In the first case, we can perform the operation without any adjustments. In the second case, we multiply 4 by 2 and get 8 as the 
  result, which is out of the required range. To correct it, we calculate the remainder after a division by 5 (written as <code>8 % 5</code> in F#), 
  which gives us 3. Finally, the last example shows that we’d also like to be able to use our type with lists. If we add values 0, 1, 2
  and 3, we get 6 which is adjusted to 1.</p>
