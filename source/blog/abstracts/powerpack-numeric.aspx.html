<p>In this article, we'll briefly look at two numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. 
  The type <code>complex</code> represents complex numbers consisting of real and imaginary parts. 
  Both parts are stored as a floating point numbers. The type <code>BigRational</code> represents 
  rational numbers consisting of numerator and denominator of arbitrary sizes. Integers of arbitrary
  size are represented using <code>BigInteger</code> type that is available in .NET 4.0 
  (in the <code>System.Numerics.dll</code> assembly). On .NET 2.0, the <code>BigInteger</code>
  type is also a part of F# PowerPack.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">This article is a part of a series that covers some F# and F# PowerPack features for 
  numerical computing. Other articles in this series discuss matrices, defining custom
  numeric types and writing generic code. For links to other parts, see
