<p>In this part of the article series about <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>we're going to 
  implement a slightly more complicated application using the library that I introduced
  in the previous three articles. We're going to use basic event stream queries from the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">second article</a> 
  as well as advanced operators introduced in the <a href="reactive-iii-linqoperators.aspx">third part</a>.
  This time, I'll also show the F# version of all the examples, so we're going to build on the ideas from
  the <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">first part</a>.</p>

<p>I originally wanted to write the demo only in Visual Basic, because I think that
  it is really amazig to show an idea that came from functional programming in a language
  that no one (maybe until recently) connects with functional programming. Then I realized that
  I really want to show the F# version too, because F# was an inspiration for the whole
  <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> idea and it is interesting alone as well. But finally,
  I thought that don't showing the C# version may look offensive to many readers (especially 
  since I'm still C# MVP...). So, I ended up writing the game in all three languages, but 
  the code is surprisingly similar in all of them!</p>
