<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/" type="external">Lang.NET Symposium</a> and I also did a short presentation about Phalanger (below you can find the demos and slides from my talk). By the way – during the trip from Prague to Seattle I missed a connecting flight from Paris, so I had one day to visit Paris and since I was traveling on Saturday I actually quite enjoyed it :-), so that’s where the picture comes from.</p>

<p>Overall it was really a fantastic event with many great talks from many interesting people. I hope that there will be recordings as a last year, so I won’t comment every topic that I found interesting (that would be really a long post). But just quickly – people from Microsoft often talked about DLR (dynamic language runtime) related topics, which was interesting as we’re planning to look at DLR in Phalanger. Luckily, <a href="http://netevil.org/" type="external">Wez Furlong</a> from the PHP community was there too, so we discussed how we could work on “PHP on DLR” project together (see also our <a href="http://news.php.net/php.on.dlr" type="external">mailing list</a>).</p>

<p>There were also two talks about F# (from <a type="external"  href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lukeh">Luke Hoban</a> and <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/" type="external">Harry Pierson</a>), and it was a lot of fun to hang out with them. Finally, Erik Meijer presented the <a href="http://labs.live.com/volta" type="external">Volta</a> project, which I was particularly interested in as it shares many goals and ideas with my F# Web Tools.</p>

<p>Non-Microsoft talks covered wider range of topics including Mono and Moonlight project (by <a href="http://tirania.org/blog" type="external">Miguel de Icaza</a>) and I actually had a chance to talk with Miguel about Phalanger and we even tried running the Helicopter sample on Moonlight – there were some issues, but it seems quite promising, so I hope to have the sample running on Moonlight on Linux quite soon! Miguel mentioned that the installation of Moonlight is currently a bit painful (due to some issues with media codecs), but it should be fixed in next few weeks, so I hope to be able to try it on my machine too!</p>
