  The F# language has been around for longer than many people suspect. My <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/fsquotations.aspx">first, completely outdated,
  blog post</a> was from May 2006. The Microsoft Research releases, sometime around 2006 were the
  first stable versions that gained some interest and slowly attracted commercial users.
</p>

<p>A lot has changed since the early days. F# now includes powerful features like <em>computation expressions</em>
  and <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and F# 3.0 comes with unique <em>type provider</em> mechanism.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing number of users from diverse domains: F# is used to model complex domains
  in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/TobiasGedell_EdenAnFWPFFrameworkForBuildingGUITools.pdf">finance</a> and science; asynchronous and concurrent features are used to write server-side components
  of <a href="http://theburningmonk.com/">social games</a> and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trelford-functional">trading systems</a>,
  but also in <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/dl/techmesh-london-2012/slides/AdamGranicz_DevelopingAndIntegratingWebSharperApplicationsWithFacebook.pdf">web programming</a>;
  the expressivity of F# is used by machine learning experts to
  handle dirty data or <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=293">classify XBox players</a>. Moreover, the <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a>
  has been recently founded to support the collaboration between different commercial users, open-source 
  community and academia.
</p>

<p>There is an increasing interest in F#, but many of those who approach it ask (excellent) questions such as:
  <em>"In what problem domains can I benefit from F#?"</em> or <em>"How do I use F# in finance/science/gaming or web programming?"</em>
  and most importantly <em>"How do I approach different problems in F#?"</em>
</p>
