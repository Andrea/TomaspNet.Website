For some time now, I've been writing my F# blog posts (and other F# articles 
published elsewhere) by combining F# code snippets and Markdown formatting. In fact,
I even wrote a Markdown parser in F# so that I can post-process documents (to 
generate references etc). You can read about the Markdown parser in an upcoming
[F# Deep Dives](http://manning.com/petricek2/) book - currently, it is available 
as a free chapter!

During the Christmas break, I finally found enough time to clean-up the code I
was using and package it properly into a documented library that is easy to install and use.
Here are the most important links:

 - [F# Formatting home page](http://tpetricek.github.com/FSharp.Formatting)
 - [F# Formatting source code](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting) on GitHub
 - [F# Formatting package](https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Formatting) on NuGet
