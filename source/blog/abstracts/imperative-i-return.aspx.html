<p>One of the limitations of F# is that it doesn't very well support some of the 
  advanced imperative language constructs such as <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>
  or imperative style of returning value from a function, meaning that you can't write
  something like <code>return false</code> in the middle of the function. This has 
  good reasons. F# doesn't in principle have the notion of <em>currently executing statement</em>
  and instead treat every code you write as an expression. Clearly, when there is no 
  <em>current statement</em>, we cannot jump to other statements. If you're looking
  for more information about these basic principles, you can take a look at my book 
  <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional 
  Programming</a>, which covers this distinction in details in chapter 2, but we'll look 
  at a brief example that will clarify this idea shortly.</p>

<p>Often, there is really no need to use <code>break</code> or other imperative constructs
  in F#, because you can write the same thing more elegantly using one of the provided higher
  order function such as <code>Seq.exists</code> or <code>Seq.tryfind</code>. However,
  there are still some cases where the imperative programming style makes it easier 
  to express our original intention. Also, implementing your own higher order
  functions (akin to <code>Seq.exists</code>) would sometimes be much easier if we
  could just use imperative return.</p>  
<p>So, what can be done about this?</p>
