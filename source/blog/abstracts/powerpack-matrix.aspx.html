 <p>In the <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/powerpack-numeric.aspx">previous article of this 
  series</a>, we looked at <code>complex</code> and <code>BigRational</code>, which are two 
  numeric types that are available in F# PowerPack. Aside from these two, the PowerPack 
  library also contains a type <code>matrix</code> representing a two-dimensional matrix
  of floating-point values.</p>

<p>In this article, you'll learn how to work with matrices in F#, using some 
  of the functions provided by F# PowerPack. I'll demonstrate the library using an 
  example that represents <em>graphs</em> using a, so called, <em>adjacency matrix</em>.
  If you're not familiar with this concept, you don't need to worry. It is quite simple
  and it will be clear once we look at an example.
  The matrix represents which vertices of a graph are connected with other vertices by 
  an edge. Many of the standard operations on matrices are useful when working with 
  adjacency matrix, so this tutorial will cover the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating matrices from lists and using functions from the <code>Matrix</code> module</li>
  <li>Using slices to read or modify a part of matrix</li>
  <li>Performing standard operations with matrices such as transposition and matrix multiplication</li>
  <li>Using higher order functions for working with matrices</li>
</ul>


<p style="font-style:italic;">This article is a part of a series that covers some F# and F# PowerPack features for 
  numerical computing. Other articles in this series discuss matrices, defining custom
  numeric types and writing generic code. For links to other parts, see
