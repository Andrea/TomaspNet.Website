<p>In functional programming, parser combinators are a powerful way of writing parsers. 
A parser is a function that, given some input, returns possible parsed values and 
the rest of the input. Parsers can be written using combinators for composition, for
example run two parsers in sequence or perform one parser any number of times.</p>

<p>Parsers can also implement the monad structure. In some cases, this makes the parser
less efficient, but it is an elegant way of composing parsers and we can also benefit
from the syntactic support for monads. In this article, we implement a simple parser
combinators for F# and we look what additional expressive power we can get from the
<em>joinad</em> structure and <code>match!</code> construct. This article is largely based on a
previous article <em>"Fun with Parallel Monad Comprehensions"</em>, which can be found on the
<a href="../pubs.html">publications</a> page.</p>
