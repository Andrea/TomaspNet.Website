<p>In the third part of the F# Overview article series, we will look at language features that are mostly well known, because they are present in most of the currently used programming languages. Indeed, I'm talking about imperative programming, which is a common way for storing and manipulating application data and about object oriented programming which is used for structuring complex programs.</p>
<p>In general, F# tries to make using them together with the functional constructs described in the <a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx">previous part</a> [<a href="fsharp-ii-functional.aspx" target="_blank">^</a>] as natural as possible, which yields several very powerful language constructs.</p>
