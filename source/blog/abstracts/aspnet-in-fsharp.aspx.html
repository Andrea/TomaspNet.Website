<p>As I mentioned earlier, I spent three months as an intern in Microsoft Research in Cambridge last year 
  and I was working with Don Syme and James Margetson from the F# team. Most of the time I was working
  on the F# Web Toolkit, which I introduced on the blog some time ago [<a href="#myfsstuff">1</a>],
  but I also worked on a few additions that are now part of the F# release. Probably the most useful addition is 
  a new implementation of the CodeDOM provider for the F# language which makes it possible to use ASP.NET
  smoothly from F# (but it can be used in some other scenarios as well) together with two ASP.NET sample
  applications that you can explore and use as a basis for your web sites. This was actually a part of the
  distribution for a few months now (I of course wanted to write this article much earlier...), so you may 
  have already noticed, but anyway, I'd still like to write down a short description of these ASP.NET samples
  and also a few tips for those who're interested in writing web applications in F#.
