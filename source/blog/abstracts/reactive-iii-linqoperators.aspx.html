<p>In the <a href="reactive-ii-csevents.aspx">previous article</a>, I introduced <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong>.
  I explained the different point of view that we can use when working with .NET events. The idea is that
  .NET events can be viewed as streams of values. The value is information about the event (such as position
  of a mouse click or a mouse movement). These streams can be processed using LINQ queries - we can for example
  filter all values that are not interesting for us using <code>where</code> LINQ clause. For example if we want to handle
  clicks only in some specified area.</p>
<p>In the previous article, I talked about basic LINQ query operators such as <code>select</code> and <code>where</code>
  and some useful methods that <strong>Reactive LINQ</strong> provides (for example for merging event streams).
  Today, we'll take a look at two more advanced kinds of operations that we can use for working with event streams. 
  In particular, we'll talk about aggregation operators (that you certainly know from LINQ) and about switching. 
  Switching is a concept from functional reactive programming and it allows us to change dynamically how the 
  application behaves. However, I'll explain this in a more detail soon.</p>
<p>In this article, I'm going to use mostly C# (and some Visual Basic). The functionality that I'm describing
  in this part isn't part of the standard F# <code>Event</code> module that I discussed in 
  <a href="reactive-i-fsevents.aspx">the first part</a>. I implemented most of them in F# too, but I'm not going
  to write the samples in both of the versions in this part. If you've seen the first two articles, you'll be 
  definitely able to use the F# versions as well, because they follow exactly the same ideas as the C#/LINQ versions.
  I'm going to talk about a larger demo application in the last section and I'll show an F# version as well,
  so you'll see some F# examples in the next part. This part serves more as a reference of the available
  operators, so you may read only some parts of it, then jump to the last one (to see an exciting example!) 
  and then come back here.</p>
