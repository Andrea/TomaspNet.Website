<p>After a few years, I finally managed to find the time to attend the 
  <a href="http://www.2013mvpsummit.com/">MVP Summit</a> this year. The Summit is
  an annual event where people who are active in Microsoft technical communities come
  to the Microsoft headquarters to learn about new things (and, of course, tell them 
  how they should be doing their job :-)). The Summit is a great place to meet interesting
  people (so if you're reading this and will be there, definitely get in touch!)
</p>

<p>The good news - for those interested in F# - is that I'll be doing two F# talks 
  on the way. I'll stop in <strong>Boston</strong> on <strong>February 13</strong> and then in <strong>New York</strong> on <strong>February 25</strong>.
  I'll be talking about different topics (Google tells me that the distance is 
  <em>only</em> 216 miles!)
