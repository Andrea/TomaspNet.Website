<p>Some time ago, I wrote an article about useful utility called <a href="http://www.tomasp.net/blog/quotvis.aspx">F# quotations visualizer</a>.
  This utility can be used to show visual representation of F# quotations, that can represent (subset of) source code written in F#.
  There are two ways that you can use to get F# quotations - first is using operators <code>&lt;@@@@ ... @@@@&gt;</code> (this
  returns quotation of the code written inside the operator), second method is to get quotation of top level definition from compiled 
  F# assembly (you have to explicitly enable this using command line switch <code>--enable-quotation-data</code> while compiling assembly).
</p>
<p>Because I added several new features to the original Quotations visualizer, I decided to publish the latest version - here is the list of main improvements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rewritten using active patterns (new F# language feature)</li>
  <li>It is possible to extract quotations from compiled F# assembly (if it contains quotation data)</li>
  <li>Added support for several missing language constructs</li>
</ul>
