<p>I've been working on the <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Real World Functional Programming in .NET</a>
  book for quite some time now. In fact, I had the first discussions with Michael Stephens 
  from Manning in March last year and I started thinking about the book at that time, so it 
  has been occupying my mind for almost a year now! Until recently, I was feeling that
  we're not getting much closer to the end of this project, because writing a book is just 
  <em>a lot</em> of work. However, I think I can finally see that we're getting closer to
  actually finishing the book. At Manning, we've recently finished the second review, which means
  that I've just got another set of very useful comments - a big thanks to all the reviewers! 
  I'm also getting close to finishing the first draft of the whole manuscript (depending on the
  reviews, the content may still change a bit, but I expect to write at most one new chapter
  from now). Hopefully, the drafts will soon make it to the MEAP release of the book.</p>
