<p>About a week ago I posted <a href="fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">the first part</a> of my F# webcast series.
  It focused on explainining the basic ideas behind functional programming such as immutability, recursion
  and passing functions as arguments to other functions (or methods in C#). In the first part, we've seen some
  C# code to demonstrate the ideas and also a bit of F#, mainly to show the basic language features.
</p>

<p>The second part is going to be exclusively about F#. It'll demonstrate how we can start writing
  a demo application that grabs data from RSS feeds and processes them. You'll learn how to access
  .NET libraries from F# (in particular, we'll use <code>System.Net</code> and <code>System.Xml</code>).
  We'll develop the code iteratively, which means that we'll start by simply enumerating the RSS elements using <code>for</code> loop and printing the results and then we'll refactor the code to use <em>tuples</em> and <em>sequence expressions</em> to turn it into processing code that generates a sequence of feed items. Finally we'll also demonstrate how to use some of the functions from the previous part such as <code>List.filter</code> in practice.</p>
