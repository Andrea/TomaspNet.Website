<p>Over the last year, I wrote quite a lot of articles about agent-based programming in F#.
Agents (inspired by Erlang) provide a great abstraction for writing concurrent and scalable
systems. They are a great fit for both server-side development (for example, handling 
a large number of concurrent requests), but also for user interface (for example, keeping
state in an application with background tasks and interactive interface).</p>

<p>When writing reusable agents, we usually encapsulate agent in an F# object type. The 
type provides methods for sending messages to the agent. However, sometimes the agent
also needs to report some state change that can be handled by another interested agent.
This is done using F# events. However, F# events do not specify threading behaviour, 
so there is a number of options.</p>

<p>In this article (inspired by a recent email discussion), I describe three ways of 
reporting events from an agent. The options differ in what thread is used to report the
event. Choosing the right option is important as it affects scalability and simplicity
of your agent-based code.</p>
