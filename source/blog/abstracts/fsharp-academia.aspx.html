<p>The F# language was born as a combination of the pragmatic and real-world .NET 
platform and functional programming, which had a long tradition in academia. 
Many useful ideas or libraries in F# (like <em>asynchronous workflows</em> and 
<em>first-class events</em>) are inspored by research in functional programming
(namely, the work on <em>monads</em>, <em>continuations</em> and <em>functional reactive programming</em>).</p>

<p>Exchanging the ideas between the research community and the real-world is one
of the areas where F# excels. Indeed, the first applicatiosn of F# inside Microsoft
(in the Machine Learning group at Cambridge) were all about this - combining
research in machine learning with a language that can be easily used in practice.</p>

<p>However, F# and the F# users also made numerous contributions to the programming
langauge research community. Influential ideas that come from F# include 
<em>active patterns</em> and the F# style of <em>meta-programming</em> for translating F# to 
JavaScript). I think there is a lot more that the academic community can learn
from the F# community, so I'd like to invite you to talk about your ideas 
at two upcoming academic events!</p>
