<p>In the second part of the F# overview we will look at functional programming, which is probably the most important paradigm used with the F# language, because F# is built on the same grounds as many functional languages. We will first examine the standard F# data types, which are useful to allow the functional programming style and we will also look at a few functional tricks.</p> 

<p>As already mentioned in the <a href="fsharp-i-introduction.aspx">Introduction</a> for this article series,
  F# is a typed functional language, by which I mean that types of all values are determined during the compile-time. 
  However, thanks to the use of a type inference, the types are explicitly specified in the code very rarely as we will see in the 
  following examples. Basic data types (aside from a standard set of primitive numeric and textual types that are present in any 
  .NET language) available in F# are tuple, discriminated union, record, array, list, function and object. In the following 
  quick overview, we will use the F# interactive, which is a tool that compiles and executes the entered text on the fly.</p>
