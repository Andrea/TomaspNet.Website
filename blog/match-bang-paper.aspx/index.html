    <h1>Reactive, parallel and concurrent programming in F# (PADL 2011)</h1>
<p>Don Syme blogged about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/10/21/the-f-asynchronous-programming-model-padl-2010-pre-publication-draft.aspx" type="extenal">
  a paper on the F# Asynchrounous Programming Model</a> that I helped to write. Without any doubt,
  the asynchronous programming features of F# are one of the reason for its success and also 
  influence other teams in Microsoft. However, I'm very glad that there is now also an academic
  paper that makes this idea accessible to the academic community. I believe that the ideas could
  evolve in interesting ways when used in other programming languages and also, it is now easier to 
  create research projects that build on top of the F# model.</p>

<p>Don already mentioned that we have another paper accepted at PADL. The paper describes work 
  that started during my internship at Microsoft Research in 2009. It presents a simple 
  language extension for <em>computation expressions</em> that makes them even more useful 
  in some reactive, concurrent and parallel programming models. Note that this is only a 
  research project and there are currently no plans to support the extension in the F# language
  (although, if there will, eventually, be an open-source F# release, then you'll hear about the 
  extension again...)</p>

<p>Here is the abstract of the paper (accepted at <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/PADL-2011/">PADL 2011</a>) and a PDF download link:</p>

<h3 style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;">Joinads: A retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming</h3>

<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Modern challenges led to a design of a wide range of programming models for reactive, parallel 
  and concurrent programming, but these are often difficult to encode in general purpose languages. 
  We present an abstract type of computations called joinads together with a syntactic language 
  extension that aims to make it easier to use joinads in modern functional languages. </p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;padding-right:60px;font-style:italic;">
  Our extension generalizes pattern matching to work on abstract computations. It keeps a familiar 
  syntax and semantics of pattern matching making it easy to reason about code, even in a 
  non-standard programming model. We demonstrate our extension using three important programming 
  models â€“ a reactive model based on events; a concurrent model based on join calculus and a 
  parallel model using futures. All three models are implemented as libraries that benefit from 
  our syntactic extension. This makes them easier to use and also opens space for exploring new 
  useful programming models.</p>

<p>The paper can still be revised before the final publication, so any comments and suggestions
  for improvement are largely welcome. You can contact me either via comments (below) or using 
  email at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>. I would be also quite interested
  to hear from anybody who would like to implement similar feature in other programming languages
  (for example Haskell or Scala).</p>
