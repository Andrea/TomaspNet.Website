<h1>Functional Programming: Available Chapter Excerpts &amp; Discount</h1>
<p>The work on my book <a href="http://www.functional-programming.net" target="external">Functional Programming for the Real World</a>
  is slowly getting to the end. I'm currently creating index for the last couple of chapters 
  and doing final updates based on the feedback from reviews and also from the
  <a href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=460&amp;start=0" type="external">forum at manning.com</a>
  (this means that if you have some suggestions, it's the best time to post them - I haven't yet replied
  to all of them, but I'll certainly do that before the manuscript will go to the production).</p>

<h2>Look Inside the Book</h2>  
<p>If you want to look inside the book, you can read the <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/petricek_meapch1.pdf" type="external">first chapter</a>,
  which is available from Manning (a slightly updated version of the chapter should be 
  available soon). However, there are other parts of the book available
  for free. Manning occasionally publishes chapter excerpts (that is some relatively 
  stand-alone part of a chapter) as articles on various programming web sites. Since
  I haven't posted a link to any of them on the blog, here they are. The first two 
  chapters has changed quite a lot since the article was published, so you won't find 
  much from the first article in the book. However the last two are still there:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><h3><a href="http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_misc/designtechniques/article.php/c15595">Declarative Programming Style</a></h3>
    <p style="text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">Published October 10, 2008 at CodeGuru (from Chapter 2)</p>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">In this article, I'll talk about two properties of functional languages
     that together define the overall style of writing functional code. Most of the examples will be 
     implemented in C# using the new C# 3.0 functional features, however you'll also see an example in 
     F#. In many functional languages every language construct is an expression. The languages try 
     to minimize the number of built-in concepts and are very succinct and extensible. We'll see that basic 
     building blocks implemented in a functional language use recursion. However, writing every operation 
     explicitly using recursion would be difficult, so we'll look how to write a single function that 
     can be used in many variations for different purposes. These two concepts together define what a 
     declarative programming style is, so after discussing them, we'll talk about the benefits of this style.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"><a href="http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/csharp/cs_misc/designtechniques/article.php/c15595">Read the article...</a></p>      
  </li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/books/functional_programming.aspx">Immutable Data Structures in C# and F#</a></h3>
    <p style="text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">Published February 6, 2009 at CodeProject (from Chapter 3)</p>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">In this article we'll take a look at one of the several concepts that 
      together form the 'functional programming' paradigm. You probably noticed that the term functional 
      programming has appeared in many areas recently - the C# 3.0 and LINQ have been largely influenced 
      by this paradigm and many of the libraries that enable and simplify writing parallel code rely on 
      functional ideas. Microsoft also recently announced that Visual Studio 2010 will include F# - a 
      functional language - out of the box.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">The functional paradigm is based on different principles than the imperative 
      style. You may know some of the concepts already - for example 'anonymous functions' from C# 3.0 give 
      us the ability to use function as an argument to a method. In functional programming, the ability to 
      write functions that take other functions as an argument or return them as a result is one of the 
      basic principles.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right"><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/books/functional_programming.aspx">Read the article...</a></p>            
  </li>

  <li><h3><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/books/fpdependencies.aspx">Tracking Dependencies and Side-Effects Using Immutability</a></h3>
    <p style="text-indent:0px; font-style:italic">Published July 7, 2009 at CodeProject (from Chapter 11)</p>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">Using immutable data structures has many benefits. Perhaps the most 
      discussed benefit is that immutability makes it easier to parallelize the program. When all the 
      data is immutable, we can safely access them from multiple threads and there is no danger of race 
      conditions, because none of the threads can modify the shared state. You can find more 
      information about parallelization in chapter 14, but this is not the only consequence of immutability...</p>
    <p style="text-indent:0px">The benefit that we'll discuss in this article is that immutability provides 
      great clarity to your code and you can use it to better understand what code does. If a function 
      takes a list as an argument and returns a number, you can safely assume that it calculates the result 
      based on the list content, but does not modify the list. We don't have to look at any code to reach 
      that conclusion; we don't have to examine the implementation or any other functions that it calls. 
      Let's start by looking at an example that demonstrates how easy it is to introduce errors when using 
      mutable objects.</p>

<h2>Buy "Functional Programming" with 30% Discount</h2>
<p>If you're considering buying the book, you can get it <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek" type="external">from Manning</a> right now (even though it isn't
  completed yet) thanks to the MEAP program. You'll get PDF with the current manuscript and a final 
  version (including printed book if you want) when it'll be done. The <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/books/fpdependencies.aspx">last excerpt</a>
  published at CodeProject also includes a 30% discount code that you can use at check-out. The book is
  also available at Amazon (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1933988924?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tomasnet-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1933988924">UK</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933988924?tag=httptomasnet-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1933988924&amp;adid=1PX91FJ9JZV2X1YKQKN5&amp;">USA</a>),
  but in that case you'll have to wait for the final printed version (estimated for October).</p>
