<h1>Regions and navigation bar for F# in Visual Studio</h1>
<p>The beginning of a new year may be a good time for writing one lightweight blog
  post that I wanted to publish for some time now. During my last internship with the
  F# team at MSR, I did some work on improving the F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio. This
  mostly involved the usual features - automatic completion, colouring and tooltips.
  The F# IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2010 still isn't perfect, but I think it is safe
  to claim that it is the best IDE experience for a typed functional programming language
  (aside, you can vote for some F# IDE features <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2149735-improve-intellisense-support-for-f-">here</a>
  and <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2213611-provide-refactoring-support-for-f-code-">here</a>).
  </p>

<h2>Regions and navigation bar</h2>
<div class="rdecor" style="text-align:center">
<a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/regions-navbar/vs-full.png"><img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/regions-navbar/vs-small.png" title="F# with regions and navigation bar in Visual Studio" style="margin-bottom:5px;border-style:none" /><br />
<small>(Click here for a larger version)</small>
</a>
</div>

<p>Anyway, I also spent some time with prototyping and I implemented and experimental
  version of <em>navigation bar</em> and <em>code collapsing</em>. You can see
  both of the features in the attached screenshot.</p>

<p>The implementation is really just a prototype that proves that it can be done.
  There are some bugs and it doesn't implement all features that the C# version does
  (for example, if you collapse some definitions and reopen the file, all definitions
  will be expanded again). Nevertheless, it can be sometimes useful.</p>

<p>Both of the features can be enabled by modifying the <code>devenv.exe.config</code> file
  in the Visual Studio installation folder. By default, you can find it in the
  <code>Common7\IDE</code> subdirectory in
  <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0</code>. You need to add
  the following <code>appSettings</code> section to the root <code>configuration</code> element:</p>

<pre lang="xml">
&lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key="fsharp-navigationbar-enabled" value="true" /&gt;
    &lt;add key="fsharp-regions-enabled" value="true" /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
</pre>
  
  <p>After adding these two keys, you should see navigation bar and buttons for collapsing
    type and module definitions in F# source files. Keep in mind that this is just a prototype,
    so it may not always work well!</p>

  <p>I always had both of the features enabled on my machine (and some people noticed during
    various F# talks :-)), but I have to say that I haven't been using them very often. The
    collapsing of definitions is occasionally nice if you have multiple types in a single 
    file, but F# type definitions are usually quite terse. Similarly, the navigation bar is
    nice if you're editting large file (like F# type checker in <code>tc.fs</code>), but
    I usually find what I'm looking for just using search. If you enable and use the feature,
    I'd be quite interested to hear about your experience. I'm sure that the F# team
    will find the feedback useful too (you can always vote for features at 
    <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/category/30935-languages-f-">Visual Studio user voice page</a>.</p>

<h2>Plugins &amp; implementation notes </h2>

<p>With the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx">open-source release of F#</a>,
  it has become a lot easier to implement a Visual Studio plugin that extends the F# editor.
  F# parser to get information about F# source code without writing a custom parser and type-checker.
  There are quite a few projects that do that, including some that implement support for 
  collapsing of F# declarations:</p>

<ul class="spaces">
  <li><a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bec977b8-c9d9-4926-999e-e50c4498df8a"><strong>F# Outlining</strong></a>
    makes it possible to collapse blocks of F# code. In addition to the built-in functionality
    that can be enabled using a special key, the plugin also supports marking regions of code with
    <code>//#region</code> tags.</li>

  <li><a href="http://fsharpjump.codeplex.com/"><strong>FSharpJump</strong></a> provides an alternative
    navigation menu for F# files. It displays a hierarchical list of F# definitions such as 
    modules, types, members and let bindings. The plugin is available with a source code that implements
    its own simplified F# parser.</li>

  <li>Aside from navigation, <a href="http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/f-source-code-structural-colorizer-available/"><strong>F# Depth Colorizer</strong></a>
    fills the background of F# source code depending on the nesting. For example, the body
    of <code>if</code> is filled with different color than the code following the <code>if</code>.
    This makes the indentation-based syntax even easier to read.    
    The plugin is written by Brian McNamara from the F# team, so it may be the best place
    to look if you want to write similar tool yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using F# parsing service</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/monodevelop-update/github.png" class="rdecor" alt="GitHub logo" /> 

<p>The code that implements navigation bars and collapsing in the F# IntelliSense for Visual Studio
  is divided into two parts. The first part (which is not publicly available) passes information
  from F# compiler service to Visual Studio. The second part extracts information about declarations
  from the F# syntax tree (AST) obtained from the compiler service. The second part is available
  in the open-source release and so it can be used by various tools based on the F# compiler code
  (including the F# plugin for MonoDevelop).</p>

<p>I'll give a couple of pointers for those who might be interested in using (and extending) the 
  source code. The F# compiler API used by Visual Studio is implemented in the 
  <code>FSharp.Compiler.dll</code>. The most important type to look at is <code>InteractiveChecker</code>,
  which can be found in <code>service.fsi</code> file (see <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/blob/master/src/fsharp/vs/service.fsi">
  F# source code at GitHub</a>).</p>

<p>If you're interested in a sample that uses the <code>InteractiveChecker</code> type, then take
  a look at the <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fsharpbinding">F# binding for MonoDevelop</a>. 
  The simplest example is probably a command line tool <code>fsintellisense</code> that can be
  used to get IntelliSense information from via a command line (i.e. from Emacs or Vi editors).
  The tool can be found <a href="http://fsxplat.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=fsharp%20intellisense%20tool&amp;referringTitle=Home">on CodePlex</a>.</p>

<p>If you're writing plugin using <code>FSharp.Compiler.dll</code>, it is easy to get the 
  declarations using the <code>InteractiveChecker</code> type. Assuming we have an instance
  <code>checker</code> and a few other values that are required to run the parsing, we can write:</p>

<pre lang="fsharp">
// Run parsing of a file loaded in 'source'
let untypedInfo = checker.UntypedParse(fileName, source, checkOptions) 
// Get declaration items for the file
let declarations = untypedInfo.GetNavigationItems().Declarations

// Iterate over all top-level declarations (modules, types)
for topLevel in decls do
  let (s1, e1), (s2, e2) = topLevel.Declaration.Range
  printfn "[%d:%d-%d:%d] %s" s1 e1 s2 e2 topLevel.Declaration.Name
  
  // Print all child declarations (members, functions, values)
  for nested in topLevel.Nested do
    let (s1, e1), (s2, e2) = nested.Range
    printfn "  - [%d:%d-%d:%d] %s" s1 e1 s2 e2 nested.Name
</pre>

<p>The function <code>GetNavigationItems</code> is used by the Visual Studio code that 
  displays navigation bar and collapsible regions. This means that it is not fully tested
  (and may not return all the information that you'd like). However, it is a part of the 
  open-source release, and so it should be possible to improve it a bit.</p>
