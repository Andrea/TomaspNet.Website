<h1>Real-World Functional Programming: Completed and printed!</h1>
<p>If you're following my blog or if you're interested in F# or functional programming in .NET, 
  you probably noticed that I was working on a book <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>.
  At some point, we called it <em>Functional Programming for the Real-World</em>, but then we changed the title back
  to a better sounding version <em>Real-World Functional Programming</em> (subtitle <em>With examples
  in F# and C#</em>). The book is also reason for a lower number of blog posts over the last year. Over the last 
  month or so, we were doing the final edits, reviewing the final PDF version (I fixed quite a lot minor 
  issues, synchronized book with the Beta 2 F# release and so on). Anyway, before a few days, I received the following 
  email (as an author, I receive the same emails as those who ordered the book through the <a href="http://www.manning.com/about/meap.html">Manning 
  Early Access Program</a>, so that I can see what we're sending to our dear readers):</p>

<table><tr><td>
<img style="margin:10px" src="/articles/book-completed/cover.png" />
</td><td>
<p style="font-style:italic; margin:10px 30px 10px 10px; text-indent:0px;">
Dear Tomas Petricek, <br />
We are pleased to announce that <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> is now complete! As a MEAP subscriber 
you can download your copy of the finished ebook right now! (...) This ebook is the final version, 
identical to the softbound edition, which is currently being printed and will be available on <strong>December 24</strong>. 
If you chose the printed book option when you originally subscribed, we'll ship it to you automaticallyâ€”no action required 
from you. </p>
</td></tr></table>

<h2>Finally finished!</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right. The book is finally completed and as far as I know, it has been printed last week! If you already 
  ordered the book, you won't receive it before Christmas, but it should come shortly after. I can't wait to see the
  book actually <em>printed</em>. The transition from the Word drafts I initially wrote to a final PDF version
  was already felt fantastic and I thought <em>"It looks like a real book!"</em> Among other things, there are now 
  graphical arrows with comments inside listings, which looks really great and makes code listings much easier to read.
  Now I can look forward to seeing the <em>actual book</em>. Maybe I'm too conservative, but I have to say that I'm 
  really glad that I wrote the book before everything is going to be published just electronically!</p>

<h2>Interesting links</h2>
<p>Here is a couple of links that you may found interesting if you want to look inside the book,
  download some free content and source code or if you're considering buying a copy.</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom:6px"><strong>About the Book</strong> - The <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/" type="external">official Manning homepage</a> contains links to all 
    resources. Among other things, it contains the <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/excerpt_preface.html" type="external">preface</a>
    and <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/excerpt_about.html" type="external">about the book</a> sections, which
    tell you what is the book about and what you can expect from it.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:6px"><strong>Free Chapters</strong> - When I was writing the book, the draft of the first chapter was available for a preview at Manning web site. 
    However, for completed books, Manning publishes two sample chapters. Even though I believe that chapter 1 is 
    a great introduction and motivation for reading the book, we decided to use different chapters as samples. This
    means that you can read the following two chapters for free:
    <ul style="margin-top:3px">
      <li><a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter4.pdf" type="external">Chapter 4</a> shows
        a first real-world F# example. It uses various .NET and F# libraries to implement a program for
        drawing pie charts. It requires some understanding of functional lists and tuples as well as recursion
        (which is all introduced in chapter 3).
        </li>
      <li><a href="http://manning.com/petricek/SampleChapter12.pdf" type="external">Chapter 12</a> is far more
        advanced. It starts by showing how to work with collections of data using LINQ and F# sequence expressions.
        However, it shows that this isn't a built-in feature and can be used for "changing the meaning of code" in 
        a more general sense (if you heard of <em>monads</em> than this is the right chapter for you!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li style="margin-bottom:6px"><strong>Foreword</strong> - The book is written primarily for C# and .NET developers, so when I was looking for someone to
    write the foreword, I thought that the choice could reflect this focus. So, instead of asking
    someone from the F# team, I asked <strong>Mads Torgersen</strong> who is a C# Language PM at Microsoft.
    His <a href="http://manning.com/petricek/excerpt_foreword.html" type="external">nice foreword</a>
    is an interesting point of view at functional programming from a C# language designer.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:6px"><strong>Source Code</strong> - I uploaded the source code
    (including all the completed sample applications, library for functional programming in C#, etc.) to an
    MSDN Code Gallery page <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/realworldfp" type="external">Real-World Functional Programming Samples</a>,
    so you'll find the most recent version of source code there. In addition, there are a few examples
    that are referenced from the printed book. I'm planning to publish these here on <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog">my blog</a> 
    as well as on the <a href="http://functional-programming.net">book's web site</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Get it Now</strong> - Finally, if you want to buy the book, you can order it <a type="external" href="http://www.manning.com/petricek">directly from Manning</a>, or go to 
    <a type="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933988924?tag=httptomasnet-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1933988924&amp;adid=0F1DP260JGG4KY0CDGP6">Amazon.com</a>,
    <a type="external" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1933988924?tag=tomasnet-21&amp;camp=1406&amp;creative=6394&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1933988924&amp;adid=1CTY87YCCQEJW965GNDF">Amazon.co.uk</a>
    or your favorite book store. In every case, you'll receive the book after Christmas and you can 
    get an electronic version too.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More from Manning</h2>
<p>The screenshot on the right shows <strong>Real-World Functional Programming</strong> listed 
  on the Manning homepage as a <em>hot new</em> release - if you go to their web site, you can no longer
  find my book in the right column (Manning Early Access), but it has moved to the left column (New and Recent Releases)!</p>
<p>Anyway, I also wanted to draw your attention to a special action that Manning is organizing this month.
  You have a chance to win an ebook every day and there are also special actions each day (also, there
  were some MEGADEALS on Mondays, so it may be a good idea to check the web site next Monday :-). I
  don't have any insider information, but if you want to buy my book with discount, you may want to 
  check it out!</p>

</ul>

<p>That's all about the book for today! I hope I'll have more time for blogging now that the book is finally done. I'm planning to write about a few topics that I briefly touched in the book, but didn't have the space to fully explain them. I'm also working on a series about using the <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/acceleratorv2">Accelerator</a> project that allows you to program GPUs in any managed language... The first article from the series will be available in a few days.</p>
