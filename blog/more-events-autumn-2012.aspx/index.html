<h1>Learn F# at TechMesh and SkillsMetter</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/more-events-autumn-2012/tomas-qcon.jpg" class="rdecor" title="Tomas Petricek" style="margin-bottom:15px"/>

<p>Autumn is a busy period and I already invited you to a 
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/events-autumn-2012.aspx">couple of interesting events</a>, 
  but there are two more events that you definitely should not miss.
  In only two weeks, you can come to two-day <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progfsharp-2012">Progressive F# Tutorials</a>
  packed with tutorials for both F# beginners and experts. At the beginning of December,
  the <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/">TechMesh Conference</a> comes with three days of
  talks about alternative (and future) technologies.
</p>

<p>I'll be speaking at both Progressive F# Tutorials and TechMesh and I'm also doing a tutorial
  at TechMesh, so if you want to learn about F#, type providers in F# 3.0 and financial computing
  with F#, here are some talks that you should not miss...
</p>

<h2>F# trainings in London and New York</h2>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/autumn-2011-talks/sm.gif" class="ldecor" />
<p>Aside from conferences, we're still offering F# trainings at SkillsMatter suitable for both
  <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/functional-programming-in-dot-net/dh-2239">C# programmers who want to broaden their skills</a> and
  <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/scala/real-world-f-programming/dh-2239">those who want to use F# in practice right now</a>.
  The courses are available in <strong>London</strong> and <strong>New York</strong> and if you cannot find
  a date that would suit you, drop me a note at <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a>!
</p>

<div style="clear:both;font-size:90%;border:1px solid #381400;background:#ded0b0;font-family:'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif; margin:10px 30px 30px 30px; padding:4px;">
  <strong style="font-variant:small-caps">Special offer!</strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;
  As a special offer for the readers of my blog, I'd like to offer <strong>20% off</strong> 
  the full price. To register, <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net?subject=F%23 Trainings">email
  me directly</a> with the training and location you're interested in.
  If you're interested in a private training or booking for multiple attendees, 
  <a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">get in touch as well</a>!

<h2>Progressive F# Tutorials (November 1.-2.)</h2>

<img src="http://skillsmatter.com/custom/images/progfsharp150x170.png" class="rdecor" />

<p>The event consists of almost 10 talks and tutorials in two parallel tracks, aimed at beginners
  as well as experts. The keynote by Don Syme will introduce F# type providers, Robert Pickering
  will introduce F# through music and you'll also learn about web programming and cloud programming
  in F#!</p>
<p>I'll be participating in the "Programming with the stars" session where you'll learn how 
  F# programmers think about problem solving and I'm doing a tutorial with Simon Cousins on 
  "Concurrent time-series data processing" - a very hands-on and real-world session explaining
  agents, pipelines and other useful patterns.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last chance to <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progfsharp-2012">register now via SkillsMatter</a>!</li>
  <li>See you on <strong>1st and 2nd November</strong> in <strong>London</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>TechMesh 2012 (December 4.-6.)</h2>

<p>TechMesh is a three day conference about alternative, emerging and future technologies,
  so this is definitely an event that you should not miss! The speaker list includes some
  big names in the industry as well as from the academia.</p>

  <img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/more-events-autumn-2012/techmesh.png" class="rdecor" />

<ul>
  <li><p>I'll be presenting the recent developments in F# 3.0 in a talk <strong>How F# Learned to Stop 
  Worrying and Love the Data</strong>.
  You'll learn how F# makes it easy to access data, explore data sources and I'll also 
  show how to call REST APIs from F#.</p></li>

<li><p>F# is being used in a number of financial organizations in London and worldwide, so I'm
  also doing a tutorial on <strong>Financial computing with F#</strong>. You'll learn how to access
  and analyze historical stock prices, how to implement financial models and how to price
  options using the Black-Scholes formula.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To register, visit the <a href="http://techmeshconf.com/">TechMesh 2012 Conference Web site</a>. The
  conference will be held in <strong>London</strong> between <strong>4th and 6th December</strong>.
  Other confirmed F# speakers include Adam Granicz and Luca Bolognese.

    <p>I'm finishing PhD in computer science at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.
      I'm working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed 
      prog&shy;ramming or data-flow). See <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tp322/">my academic page</a> for
      more.</p>
