    <h1>Reactive Programming with F# in London</h1>
<p>If you’re a registered member of the 
  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/" type="external">F#unctional Londoners</a> 
  user group, then you maybe already know that I'll be visiting London 
  on <strong>June 23</strong> and I’ll be talking about <strong>Reactive programming with F#</strong>. 
  If you're not a registered member and occasionally visit London, then you should definitely 
  register. The user group is organized by Carolyn Miller and <a href="http://www.trelford.com/blog/" type="external">Phil Trelford</a>
  (whom I met some time ago at Microsoft Research in Cambridge). Among others, previous speakers
  include <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/" type="external">Robert Pickering</a> (who also 
  presented some samples based on my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/accelerator-intro.aspx">F# and Accelerator</a> series).
  Finally, another reason for joining the group is that it has a great name (as well as a logo)!</p>

<h2>When, what &amp; where?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/FSharpLondon/calendar/13501027/" type="external">Tomas Petricek on Reactive Programming with F#</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Date &amp; time:</strong> 23 June (Wednesday), 6:30 PM</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> The Skills Matter eXchange, 116-120 Goswell Road, London</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I'll also have a free copy of my <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek" type="external">Real-World Functional Programming</a> book to give away during the talk!</p>
<h2>Reactive Programming with F#</h2>
<p>I'm sure you're already convinced to come. Nevertheless, you may still want to know 
  what I'm going to talk about. There are many areas where F# offers clear benefits such as
  parallel &amp; concurrent programming. I believe that <strong>reactive programming</strong>
  is another great area for F#. In reactive programming, we face quite different problems than
  in other programming styles. We (as the authors of the application) can no longer specify what
  the application should do. Instead, the application needs to be able to handle many possible
  combinations of events. This aspect of programming is sometimes called <em>inversion of control</em>.</p>
<p>Reactive programming is important for programming user interfaces, especially today when
  user interfaces are becoming more interactive and more "fancy". To demonstrate this, I'm working on some nice <strong>Silverlight</strong> demos for the talk! However, it is also needed
  to handle other kinds of events such as completion of background task or message from 
  other application. We'll look at the two essential techniques that F# provides for reactive
  programming:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Declarative event combinators</strong> - one way of writing reactive applications
    is to specify the whole event processing declaratively by saying "what" should be done with 
    occurrences of events. This is particularly useful when we need to encode simpler
    logic with a clear <em>data-flow</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Imperative using workflows</strong> - for more complicated interactions, we can
    use <em>asynchronous workflows</em>. This makes the code more explicit, but we get full 
    control over the <em>control-flow</em> of the application. Even though this approach is 
    more "imperative" it can be used for writing nicely composable functional code as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you at the talk next week!</p>
