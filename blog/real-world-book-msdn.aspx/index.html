  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="More than a year ago, I started working on a writing project done with Manning and MSDN team. The idea was to adapt parts of my Real-World Functional Programming book, add some new practical topics and publish the articles on MSDN under the official F# documentation. I'm happy to announce that the articles, covering ASP.NET, F# asynchronous programming and agents, charting and more are now available on MSDN!">

<h1>Real-World F# Articles on MSDN</h1>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/articles/real-world-book-msdn/msdn.jpg" style="float:right;margin:0px 15px 15px 15px;" />
<p>More than a year ago, Mike Stephens from <a href="http://manning.com">Manning</a> (who
 was also behind my <a href="http://manning.com/petricek">Real-World Functional Programming</a>
 book) asked me if I'd be interested in collaborating on a project for MSDN. The idea 
 was to collaborate with Microsoft on creating some additional content for the official
 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd233154(VS.100).aspx">F# Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the new content appeared on MSDN, so I finally have an excuse for the
  recent lack of blogging! Although the content contains a large number of new articles
  that are not based on my book, you can find it in the MSDN section named after my
  book, right under <em>Visual F#</em>. If you can't wait to check it out, here are all the links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh314518.aspx">Real-World Functional Programming</a> section on MSDN.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Value=tomas%20petricek&amp;f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&amp;ac=8">source code for individual chapters</a> is available on MSDN Code Gallery.</li>
  <li>I also published <a href="http://functional-programming.net/msdn/">annotated TOC with source code links</a> on my functional programming web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on the articles, I also wrote about a few topics that we didn't use in the final version. You'll see them on my blog in the next few days, as soon as I edit them into a blog post form. </p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>At the moment, the information about authors on MSDN is a bit confusing, so let me clarify:</p>
<ul><li>
  The <em>Chapter I. Introducing Functional Programming</em> is based on the Real-World Functional Programming
  book, which I wrote together with <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/">Jon Skeet</a>.</li><li>
  The <em>Chapter IV. Numerical and Symbolic Computing</em> was written mainly by 
  <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~yinz/">Yin Zhu</a>, who is well known in the F# community thanks
  to his <a href="http://fdatamining.blogspot.com/">F# and Data Mining</a> blog.
</li><li>The remaining four chapters are new material written by me. They are partly based on my
  recent talks on <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/reactive-talk.aspx">reactive programming</a>,
  <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/education-and-agents-talks.aspx">concurrent programming with agents</a>
  and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/goto-loosely-structured-data.aspx">accessing data</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are quite a few people who significantly helped with the project in one way or another. Nermina Miler
and Mike Stephens from Manning helped to manage everything. Don Syme and Gordon Hogenson (from
the F# documentation team) helped by reviewing several versions of the TOC. Keith Battocchi 
and Gordon also carefuly reviewed all the articles. Thanks!
</p>

<h2>Chapter overview</h2>
<p>In the rest of the article, I'll give a brief overview of each chapter, so that you know
  what new exciting topics are now covered as part of the F# Documentation on MSDN.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273069.aspx"><strong>Chapter I</strong>: Introducing Functional Programming</a></h3>
<p>
  This chapter explains the basic concepts behind functional programming such as immutability,
  first-class functions and expression-based programming. Many of the concepts are demonstrated in C# to guide programmers without 
  prior experience with F# or functional programming. It also shows the benefits that 
  follow from these concepts, such as the fact that they make testing and reasoning about programs easier.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273081.aspx"><strong>Chapter II</strong>: Server-Side Functional Programming</a></h3>
<p>This chapter explain server-side development and agent-based concurrency in F#. Agents 
  (the <code>MailboxProcessor</code> type) are introduced using a tutorial that develops 
  a simple chat server using agents, encapsulates it into a reusable .NET object and exposes it 
  as a web page using the <code>HttpListener</code> type. The chapter also implements 
  two reusable agents that solve common data processing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273071.aspx"><strong>Chapter III</strong>: Developing Client-Side Applications</a></h3>
<p>This chapter explain how to write reactive user-interfaces in F# using Silverlight.
  It covers two approaches to writing reactive applications in F#. The first approach is 
  declarative and it composes data-flow using event combinators. The second approach is 
  more imperative and it describes control-flow using F# asynchronous workflows. The chapter 
  also covers practical aspects, such as how to use F# with XAML and Microsoft Blend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273075.aspx"><strong>Chapter IV</strong>: Numerical and Symbolic Computing</a></h3>
<p><em>(This chapter is written by Yin Zhu)</em></p>
<p>This chapter explain how to use .NET libraries such as Math.NET Numerics, Microsoft Sho, 
  and F# Power Pack to implement numerical algorithms in F#. It explains what makes F# a great
  language for numerical computing and reviews various numerical libraries for .NET and F#. 
  Three tutorials cover the most common numerical libraries that can be easily used from F#.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273072.aspx"><strong>Chapter V</strong>: Developing Data-Driven Websites</a></h3>
<p>This chapter explains how to use .NET web and data technologies  from F#.
  It uses F# to develop the model and controllers of an ASP.NET MVC web application with a 
  front-end created using C# and Razor. It shows how to use asynchronous workflows to 
  write more efficient web pages and how to easily access SQL database using dynamic operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh273079.aspx"><strong>Chapter VI</strong>: Visualizing Data with .NET Charts</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the options for visualizing data in F#. The chapter consists of several
  larger tutorials that cover .NET Chart Controls, the 
  <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/FSharpChart-b59073f5">FSharpChart</a> wrapper for F#, 
  Microsoft Excel and briefly also gnuplot. The libraries are demonstrated a few larger tutorials, 
  such as visualization of financial data, and How To articles that show F# code to create 
  common chart types.</p>
</li>

    <p>I'm finishing PhD in computer science at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>.
      I'm working on making better types for programs that run in rich context (like F# type providers, distributed
